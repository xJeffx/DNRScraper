 Survey Date = '2001-07-18',  County Name = 'Aitkin', Lake Name = 'Bachelor' 
 Lake Clarity = '' 
 Narrative = '<p>Bachelor Lake is a moderately fertile 53 acre lake located in Aitkin County just southwest of the city of Aitkin.  The shoreline surrounding the lake has minimal development with most of the shoreline made up of marshland, undeveloped forest or woodland, and grassland.  The lake is characterized by a larger, deep basin connected to a small, shallow basin via a shallow, narrow channel.  Since 57% of the lake's surface area is made up of water depths less than 15 feet, there may be potential for a partial fish winterkill during favorable winterkill conditions.  However, a fish winterkill has never been reported.  Currently, management of the fishery is primarily for northern pike and black crappie with largemouth bass and bluegill sunfish as the secondary management species.A standard lake survey was conducted during the week of July 18, 2001 to evaluate the current status of the fish population, the physical, chemical and biological factors concerning habitat, and the water quality.  Evaluation of the fish population utilized spring night electrofishing, three gill nets, nine trap nets, and two shoreline seine hauls.  The selected gear types were chosen based on guidelines obtained from the MN DNR Manual for Instructions for Lake Survey.  Habitat and water quality data were also collected based on guidelines from this manual.  Northern pike abundance and an average weight of 2.8 pounds were within a normal range for this type of lake.  However, northern pike numbers have more than doubled since 1991.  Pike lengths ranged from 13.7 to 35.2 inches.  Bachelor Lake northern pike growth was normal when compared to statewide averages.  Spring night electrofishing and summer trap netting sampled 57 largemouth bass with lengths extending from 5.7 to 16.5 inches.  Bass abundance appears to be good with a broad range of sizes represented.  Black crappie numbers were found at above normal levels for this lake type.  When compared to historical assessments, crappie abundance in 2001 was the highest ever documented by DNR surveys.  Crappie lengths ranged from 3.9 to 10.8 inches with 71% of the fish sampled between 7.0 and 8.5 inches.  Black crappie growth was normal at all ages.  Both bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish were at normal abundance levels in 2001.  Bluegill lengths extended from 3.4 to 8.1 inches with an average length of 5.6 inches and pumpkinseed sunfish ranged from 3.4 to 8.5 inches with an average length of 6.3 inches.   Sunfish growth was found to be normal at ages 1 and 6-9 and below normal at ages 2-5.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for northern pike, were sampled at a normal level for this lake type.  The sampled fish community in Bachelor Lake also included blackchin shiner, dog fish, brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Johnny darter, rock bass, and yellow bullhead.An angler fishing Bachelor Lake will have to gain permission to access through private property since there is not a public access.  An abundance of northern pike and largemouth bass may be encountered with a good chance of hooking a memorable sized fish.  Fishing enthusiasts who target panfish can expect a fair number of black crappie, bluegill sunfish, and pumpkinseed sunfish, but sizes are small.  Anglers are encouraged to be selective if they keep fish by harvesting the smaller ones for eating and releasing the larger ones.  Releasing the larger fish will help maintain the current quality of the fish population and provide future angling opportunities for others who would like to catch a quality sized fish.  Shoreline property owners and surrounding land users within the watershed can maintain or improve water quality by protecting the existing abundance of natural shoreline, updating outdated or failing septic systems, using phosphorus free fertilizer (if needed) on surrounding lawns or crop land, utilizing crop farming practices that reduce run-off, limiting aquatic plant removal or disturbance, and limiting construction of impervious surfaces near the shoreline.</p>'

 Survey Date = '2012-08-20',  County Name = 'Aitkin', Lake Name = 'Boot' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/21/2012 Clarity: 8' 
 Narrative = '<p>Boot Lake is a small, infertile, bog stained lake located in northeastern Aitkin County.  In the past anglers have had to get permission to cross private property to access the lake, but now there is a county administered carry-in access on the north side of the lake.   <br> 
 <br> 
Historically, the lake has had a well-structured northern pike population.  The 2012 pike catch of 9.8 per gill net was similar to previous assessments, which have been above normal compared to similar lakes.  Size decreased from the last assessment with the average length of pike changing from 24 inches in 2002, to just 20 inches in 2012. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegills are typically abundant in Boot Lake.  Because of the large number of fish and the low fertility of the water, growth rates for these fish are slow and typically below county averages.  Bluegill trap net catches were low in 2012, in part because the lake was sampled in August instead of June when water temperatures are high and fish are less susceptible to survey nets.  In addition, unusual precipitation patterns may have also negatively influenced the bluegill catch.  Bluegill size averaged 5.3 inches with fish up to 7.1 inches sampled.  Panfish anglers may catch respectable sized hybrid sunfish which averaged 7.0 inches with fish measuring up to 8.5 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Similar to bluegill, black crappie can be abundant, but are slow growing in Boot Lake.  Survey nets indicate a decrease in abundance of black crappie from 2002, but still within the normal range for this type of lake.  The average black crappie caught in this survey was about 8" long and weighed approximately a quarter of a pound.  The largest black crappie caught was 10" in length.   <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth bass also provide angling opportunities in Boot Lake.  Standard survey nets do not sample bass in large numbers and only seven largemouth bass were sampled in 2012.  While bass grow slowly, they do reach respectable size with fish up to 15.5 inches captured in this survey.   <br>

 Survey Date = '2001-08-13',  County Name = 'Aitkin', Lake Name = 'Cedar' 
 Lake Clarity = '' 
 Narrative = '<p>Cedar Lake is a moderately fertile 232 acre lake located in south central Aitkin County just east of Mille Lacs Lake.  Because a public access is currently not available, anglers will have to gain access through private land owners.  The shoreline surrounding the lake is minimally developed with most of the shoreline composed of undeveloped forest or woodland, marshland, and grassland.  The surrounding watershed is characterized by the following land uses listed in order of abundance: undeveloped forest or woodland, bogs, rural residential development, marshland, and grassland.  Since shallow water depths are characteristic of this basin along with good fertility, this type of lake may experience low oxygen levels during the winter season which can cause partial or complete fish winterkills.  According to historical DNR Fisheries surveys, known fish winterkills occurred in 1978/79 and 1988/89.  Since 1993, the Cedar Lake Association has operated an aeration system as an effort to prevent or reduce winterkill.  Due to the varying intensities of winterkill and the unknown effectiveness of the current aeration system, small partial winterkills may go undetected.  Hence, the fish community in Cedar Lake may be subject to consistent change and periodically dominated by an abundance of low oxygen tolerant species such as bullhead.  Currently, Cedar Lake is managed for black crappie and bluegill sunfish with northern pike as the secondary management species.During the open water season of 2001, a standard lake survey was conducted to evaluate the present status of the fish population, the physical, chemical, and biological factors concerning habitat, and the water quality.  The evaluation of the fishery used gill nets, trap nets, and late summer shoreline seining.  The selected gear types were chosen based on guidelines from the MN DNR Manual of Instructions for Lake Survey.  Habitat and water quality data also collected based on these guidelines.  Bluegill sunfish and black crappie numbers were found at normal levels for lakes of this type, but their sizes were small.  Northern pike abundance was found at a normal level along with the average weight, at 2.5 pounds.  Measured northern pike ranged from 17.3 to 27.5 inches with an average length of 22.8 inches.  Walleye were first sampled in Cedar Lake in 1992 which was before any type of walleye stocking took place.  These fish most likely originated in Mille Lacs Lake and entered Cedar lake via Cedar Creek during spring high water levels.  Since the DNR does not stock walleye in lakes without a public access, the Cedar Lake Association began walleye stocking in 1993 after obtaining a permit from DNR Fisheries.  A total of 1,200 walleye fingerlings were stocked in 1993 and 350,000 walleye fry in 2000.  During the 2001 survey, four walleye from the 1993 year class were sampled with their lengths ranging from 18.9 to 21.9 inches.  Five largemouth bass that ranged from 5.5 to 18.4 inches were captured in gill and trap nets.  Since the sampling methods utilized are not the most effective for sampling largemouth bass, the sampled fish probably do not adequately represent the true population.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for northern pike and walleye, were found in low numbers.  The sampled fish community also included black and brown bullhead, dog fish, common carp, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed sunfish.  When compared to similar lakes, black and brown bullhead, dog fish, common carp, and pumpkinseed sunfish were within a normal abundance range.An angler fishing Cedar Lake may encounter a nice sized northern pike, an occasional nice walleye or largemouth bass, an abundance of small sunfish, or a fair number of smaller crappie.  Since Cedar Lake is a moderately fertile lake and land uses within a watershed surrounding a lake can influence a lakes water quality, additional nutrient input may decrease this lakes water quality and ultimately its overall health.  Shoreline property owners and other land users within the watershed can improve or maintain water quality by protecting or re-establishing buffer strips along the shoreline of lakes with native plant species; updating failing or outdated septic systems; using phosphorus free fertilizer (if needed) on surrounding lawns, gardens, or crop land; utilizing farming practices that reduce run-off; limiting aquatic plant removal or disturbance; and limiting construction of impervious surfaces near the shoreline. </p>'

 Survey Date = '1993-06-21',  County Name = 'Aitkin', Lake Name = 'Douglas' 
 Lake Clarity = '' 
 Narrative = '<p>Douglas Lake is an elongated lake with muck bays on both ends, sand along much of the rest of theshoreline, and an island in the middle. Dense vegetation grows in the bays and along the shoreline outto about 50 feet from shore. The water is moderately hard and fertile, and lightly bog-stained.Reasonable access to the lake is limited to private residences.       This survey revealed that northern pike abundance and average size (20 inches) are aboutaverage. The northerns, which were 11 to 28 inches long, have plenty to eat. The primary items on thepike menu are golden shiners, black crappies and yellow perch, all of which are more abundant thanaverage. Some  of the yellow perch and black crappies are large enough (up to 9 inches long) to supportnormal growth of even the larger pike.       Bluegill abundance is at the low end of normal and the fish are mostly over 7 inches long.Smaller bluegills are sparse, possibly because natural reproduction in Douglas Lake has been poor inthe last few years. The survey crew observed many females that had not spawned yet, despite the latedate (late June). Black crappies and yellow perch are also presently abundant enough to gobble up mostof the bluegill fry that do make it out of the nest. Intense predation on bluegill fry may furtherlimit the production of bluegills in the last few years.       Black crappies are growing slowly in Douglas Lake. Year class strength alternated between strongand weak years from 1988 to 1992. Fluctuations in both bluegill and crappie abundances probably leadsto variability in angling success.       Between 1988 and 1991 a large population of bigmouth buffalo fish became established. Acommercial fisherman removed four tons of bigmouth buffalos from the lake in June of 1992. No bigmouthbuffalos were caught during the current survey.       Black bullheads, particularly 7 to 9 inchers, were abundant. The combination of perch, shiners,bullheads and crappies probably results in a high catch rate although not necessarily for quality-sizedfish, or for northern pike which already have plenty to eat.</p>'

 Survey Date = '2008-08-04',  County Name = 'Aitkin', Lake Name = 'Fleming' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/04/2008 Clarity: 3' 
 Narrative = '<p>Fleming Lake is a shallow, very fertile lake located in central Aitkin County, five and one-half miles south of Palisade.  Fleming Lake has a history of occasional partial winterkills, although there are no recent reports of such an event.  The lake is a popular destination for many anglers in search of northern pike, bluegill and black crappie.   <br> 
 <br> 
The northern pike are not overly abundant, but they have plenty of food and are of nice size; 76% were over 24 inches.  The average size of northern pike sampled during the survey was over 27 inches long and weighed five pounds.  Although their abundance has increased steadily since we first surveyed the lake in 1978, growth rates do not appear to have been affected. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill have been increasing in recent years and are very abundant. Although growth rates are above average for Aitkin County, they do appear to be decreasing somewhat in comparison with previous assessments.  Fishing pressure may also be a limiting factor in the size structure of the bluegill population.  The number of fish over the angler preferred size (7.5 inches) is very low, although the strong 2002 year class may soon reach that mark. <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie have never been large sized in Fleming Lake.  The largest caught this year was 10 inches, but acceptable size fish, over 8 inches, are quite abundant.  This species does well in shallow, fertile lakes with a history of occasional partial winterkills.  Both summer and winter anglers should find these very abundant fish easy to catch. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch are well above average in abundance for this class of lake, which is likely why growth rates for northern pike are so fast.  They may also play a role in the dynamics of bluegill sunfish by reducing the densities of young of year bluegills, thereby increasing first year growth rates.  Maintaining a good yellow perch population is important for the health of this fishery. <br>

 Survey Date = '2015-08-24',  County Name = 'Aitkin', Lake Name = 'Horseshoe' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/27/2015 Clarity: 3' 
 Narrative = '<p>Horseshoe Lake is a 237 acre lake located in northeastern Aitkin County approximately 9 miles northeast of McGregor.  The lake is shallow with a maximum depth of only 12 ft. and summer algal blooms are relatively common.  The water is a tanin stained dark brown in color, limiting the secchi disk reading to only 3ft.  Most of the shoreline is ringed with wild rice.  Shallow water areas are comprised primarily of sand, silt, and muck with occasional areas of gravel and rubble.  Horseshoe Lake does occasionally suffer from partial winterkills, the most recent observed was a partial kill in the winter of 2007-2008.  Access can be gained either through the channel from Lake Minnewawa or through a private access on the northeast corner of the lake. <br> 
 <br> 
Historically walleye have been naturally occurring in Horseshoe Lake.  In order to improve an apparent declining natural population, walleye fry have been stocked into Horseshoe Lake, annually since 2012.  The 2015 catch of 2/gill net is up from past surveys.  All but one of the walleyes captured in the gill nets were from fry stocked years.  There is some fish movement between Horseshoe and Minnewawa.   <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike were caught in below average numbers, and their size was about average.  Fish ranged from 17" to 24.6", with an average length and weight of 21.3" and 2.0 lbs.  Lower pike densities are generally favorable for walleye management in this type of lake. <br> 
 <br> 
Perhaps what is most notable is the lake's panfish population.  Bluegill, black crappie, and yellow perch catches have decreased from the last survey.   With the decrease in abundance, there has been improvement in black crappie and bluegill sizes.  Black crappie averaged about 8" while bluegills averaged about 7.5".  Yellow perch numbers are still in the normal range for this lake class, but are probably too small to be of interest to anglers with only 2 fish over 8" sampled in 2015.  With an average length of 6.2", the perch should provide good forage for the lake's northern pike and walleye.   <br> 
 <br> 
Although abundance was relatively low, the largemouth bass population did exhibit quality sized fish.  The 3 fish observed in the trap net sample ranged from 17" to nearly 20". <br> 
 <br> 
A new survey tool was used in this survey to assess the quality of the shoreland, shoreline and aquatic areas called Score-the-Shore.  Overall Horseshoe Lake scored 69.8 out of a possible score of 100.  This score translates to a "Poor" rating, however it was only 0.2 points away from the "Fair" rating at 70.  Other lakes in the area with similar scores were Flemming (69) Waukenabo (71) and Dam (69).  Despite a poor Score-the-Shore rating, Horseshoe Lake maintains a healthy aquatic plant community with much of the shoreline rimmed with emergent and floating plants.  Maintaining healthy plant communities is important for maintaining good water quality and fish habitat.   <br>

 Lake Clarity = '' 
 Narrative = '<p>Island Lake is located in the northeastern part of Aitkin County approximately seven miles northwest of Tamarack.  The lake is 243 acres in size the majority of which is less than 15 feet deep.  The lake has a maximum depth of 25 feet and a secchi disk reading of 6.5 feet.  A variety of fish species are present in Island Lake including northern pike, bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass and yellow bullhead, however, most of these fish are small and grow slowly.  Northern pike gillnet catches reached an all time low in 2005 at 2.3 per net. Historically pike catch rates have ranged from 5 to 7 fish per net since 1975.  Pike ranged in size from 15 to 26 inches total length with a mean length of 22 inches. Growth for larger pike is slow and are consequently susceptible to over harvest in this infertile lake.  Bluegill catch rates were also at the lowest level ever observed on the lake at 15 fish per trap net. Trap net catches for bluegill have varied from 36 to 88 fish per net dating back to 1975. The growth of bluegill in Island Lake is quite slow, as it would take 6 to 8 years to produce a six-inch bluegill. Black crappie abundance has fluctuated greatly over time, which is normal for this species.  Crappies hatched in 2001 and 2002 are 4 to 6 inches long and are the most abundant year classes in the fishery. In a couple of years these fish will grow to be an acceptable size to anglers.  Other species present in low abundance include bowfin, largemouth bass, brown bullhead and yellow perch.  A commercial fish distributor stocked walleyes in 1989, however, no walleye have been sampled in subsequent DNR lake surveys indicating poor survival. Low forage abundance and predation by northern pike will likely hinder survival of stocked fingerlings in Island Lake.  Yellow bullheads do well in the lake and yet only a few are likely to be harvested by anglers.Island Lake is a remote, quiet lake with a limited amount of development along the eastern shoreline, which is viewed as a positive aspect for anglers and residents on the lake.  The infertile water and slow growth of fish will limit the lakes potential to produce large numbers of quality fish. Catch and release of larger northern pike and panfish is encouraged to maintain a well-balanced fishery. Responsible shoreline management practices will help maintain the habitat and natural qualities of the lake.</p>'

 Lake Clarity = '' 
 Narrative = '<p>McKinney Lake is a moderately fertile 60 acre basin located in northwestern Aitkin County near the town of Swatara.  The shoreline surrounding the lake has minimal residential development along the south and east/northeast shorelines with the majority of the lake margin encompassed by mixed hardwood forest interspersed with conifers and marshland.  Water depths of 15 feet or less constitute three-forths of the lake's area.  Despite the abundance of shallow water depths, a fish winterkill of any degree has never been documented in DNR Fisheries records.  Currently, the lake is managed primarily for northern pike and bluegill sunfish with largemouth bass and black crappie as the secondary management species.As per the evaluation goals of the current management plan, a population assessment was conducted during the summer of 2001 to evaluate the present status of the fish community and the water quality.  Northern pike numbers and average size (1.8 pounds) were normal for this type of lake.  Measured northern pike ranged from 12.3 to 34.2 inches in length.  Growth at all ages was normal.  Bluegill sunfish were below normal in abundance, but their average weight was above normal with lengths extending from 5.7 tp 8.4 inches.  Above average growth at ages 1-3 was determined.  McKinney Lake's black crappie were normal in abundance and ranged from 6.1 to 10.0 inches in length.  Largemouth bass were not captured by selected netting gear during this survey, but past reports from anglers indicated that largemouth have been caught.  Future surveys should include spring night electrofishing to more effectively sample largemouth bass abundance and size structure.  The sampled fish community also consisted of dog fish (bowfin), brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for northern pike, were sampled at below normal abundance levels.  When compared to the 1991 catch, sampled perch numbers decreased considerably.Anglers may encounter moderately or quality sized northern pike, bluegill sunfish, and black crappie, but numbers are not abundant.  Selective harvest, by keeping the smaller fish for eating and releasing the larger ones, is encouraged.  Releasing the larger fish will help maintain or improve the current quality of the fishery and provide future angling opportunities for others who would like to catch a memorable sized fish.  Since McKinney Lake is moderately fertile, shoreline property owners and land users within the watershed can maintain or improve the lake's current water quality by protecting the existing abundance of natural shoreline; re-establishing buffer strips of native plants along developed shoreline; updating outdated or failing septic systems; using phosphorus free fertilizer (if needed) on surrounding lawns, gardens, or crop land; utilizing farming practices that reduce run-off; limiting aquatic plant removal or disturbance; and limiting construction of impervious surfaces near the shoreline.</p>'

 Narrative = '<p>Lake users can access Pine Lake through the public access on the north end of the lake or from Big Pine Lake. Water clarity is usually good with a light bog stain to the water, though algae blooms are not uncommon. While some natural reproduction of Walleye does occur, spawning habitat is limited. Walleye fingerlings are stocked annually along with occasional fry stockings.       <br> 
 <br> 
Anglers on Pine Lake can expect moderate fishing pressure. Walleye numbers in 2014 were lower than in all previous assessments. Their abundance is below the lake class norm.  Northern Pike abundance remains below typical levels. But, like Pine Lake's Walleyes and Largemouth Bass, pike are of quality size. Sampled Northern Pike, Walleye, and Bass averaged 26.5, 17.6, and 14.8 inches respectively. Both Bluegill and Yellow Perch abundance is typical of the lake type. Bluegill size has been fairly consistent since 1999 but may be an issue for some anglers. Relatively few Bluegills topped 7 inches. Yellow Perch are small, functioning primarily as a forage species. Black Crappie abundance is currently higher than typical for the lake class. Most sampled crappie were less than 8 inches in length.</p>'

 Narrative = '<p>Sunset Lake is a 253 acre lake located on the Aitkin/Crow Wing County line 8 miles southwest of the city of Aitkin.   Although there is no designated public access on Sunset Lake, some anglers have accessed the water via the Crow Wing County Road 133 crossing.  Eighty-three percent of the lake's surface area is made up of water 15 feet deep or less.  Given the shallow depths and good fertility, Sunset Lake can experience partial winterkills, although no significant fish kills have been documented in recent decades.  The lake's immediate shoreline is primarily surrounded by mixed hardwood forest covering gently rolling hills, interspersed with residential homes or seasonal cabins.  The majority of the residential development is along the east, southeast, and northwest shores.  In addition, pasture land and crop land exist along the west shore while marshland is limited to the north and south ends of the lake and small scattered areas along the west shore.  <br> 
 <br> 
A full lake survey was conducted in 2011 to assess the current status of the fish population.  The northern pike catch, 5.6/gill net, was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Average weight was below normal at less than 1 pound.  Combining all sampling gear, sizes ranged from 9.8 to 27.9 inches and averaged 15.5 inches.  Only 5% of all pike sampled were larger than 24 inches indicating a poor size structure.  Anglers are encouraged to release northern pike 24 inches and larger to improve the size structure of the population.   <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth bass abundance has been increasing tremendously and was well above normal for this type of lake.  The bulk of the population is comprised of individuals 12 inches and smaller.  A once well balanced largemouth size structure appears to be declining as indicated by data collected in 2011.  Growth was slow, with fish needing 6 years to reach 10" in 2010 compared to 4 years in 2001.  Largemouth bass lengths extended from 5.7 to 19.0 inches with a mean length of 11.6 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
Panfish abundance was within normal ranges.  Black crappie sizes ranged from 6.2 to 12.7 inches and averaged about 8 inches.  The abundance of bluegill sunfish has fluctuated considerably in surveys dating back to 1970, and has decreased significantly since 2001, while remaining within normal ranges for this lake type.  No bluegill longer than 8 inches were measured in 2011, and the average length was 6.2 inches.  Other fish sampled in Sunset Lake included brown and yellow bullhead, bowfin, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow perch, golden shiner and Johnny darter. Based on previous survey data, yellow perch numbers have always been low and yellow bullhead numbers have historically been high, however, bullhead numbers decreased significantly in the 2011test nets.   <br> 
 <br> 
In addition to the standard summer field work, IBI (Index of Biotic Integrity) sampling was also conducted in 2011.  IBI sampling included backpack electrofishing and seining to more broadly sample the nearshore fish community and develop a fish-based index of overall lake health. <br> 
 <br> 
Catch and release of the larger game fish and panfish will help maintain or improve the quality of the fishery and provide quality angling opportunities into the future.  Land uses within a watershed surrounding a lake can influence a lake's water quality and ultimately its overall health.  Shoreline property owners and other land users within the watershed can maintain or improve water quality by protecting or re-establishing buffer strips along the shoreline with native plant species; updating failing or outdated septic systems; using phosphorus free fertilizers on surrounding lawns, gardens or crop land; utilizing farming practices that reduce run-off; limiting aquatic plant removal or disturbance; and limiting construction of impervious surfaces near shorelines.  <br>

 Lake Clarity = '' 
 Narrative = '<p>Taylor Lake is a small, moderately fertile lake located 4.5 miles southwest of the city of Aitkin in Aitkin County.  The shoreline surrounding the lake consists of marshland, bogland, and small hills covered with mixed hardwoods.  Only a small amount of shoreline development exists along the east shore.  The lake's shape is characterized by three basins with the eastern most basin largely connected to the middle basin while the western most basin is connected by a narrow channel.  Each basin has deep water depths, but half of the lake's area consists of water depths less than 15 feet.  Since an abundance of shallow water acreage characterize this basin along with good fertility, this type of lake may experience low levels of oxygen during the winter which can cause partial or severe fish kills.  According to historical oxygen monitoring data, inadequate oxygen levels were reported during several different winter seasons which did result in some degree of winterkill.  In the event of winterkill, the lake's fishery may consist of surviving species and/or of migrating fish from Cedar Lake via Cedar Creek during high water periods.  Currently, the lake is managed for black crappie, northern pike, and largemouth bass.The evaluation portion of the current management plan called for a population assessment in 2001 to evaluate the status of the fish population.  During the week of June 5, 2001, an assessment was conducted utilizing gill and trap nets.  Black crappie were not sampled during this assessment and in 1986, but historical records indicate that good numbers of crappie have been sampled in the past by DNR netting gear and local anglers.  Dramatic fluctuations in the crappie population most likely result from the occurrence of some degree of fish winterkill.  Northern pike numbers were found within a normal range for this type of lake with their lengths extending from 9.1 to 29.1 inches.  Two-thirds of the northern pike sampled were greater than 23.0 inches in length.  The abundance of largemouth bass was above normal along with their average weight.  Northern pike and largemouth bass growth was normal at all ages when compared to statewide averages.  Other fish species sampled included bluegill sunfish, brown bullhead, dog fish, pumpkinseed sunfish, and yellow perch.  Brown bullhead were normal in abundance while bluegill sunfish, dog fish, and yellow perch were sampled at levels below normal for lakes of this type.Since Taylor Lake lacks a public access, fishing enthusiasts will have to obtain permission from a private landowner to access the lake.  Anglers who target northern pike or largemouth bass are likely to encounter low numbers of pike that are quality sized or a good number of smaller largemouth bass.  Panfish numbers appear to be sparse at this time.  Because the lake has the potential for some degree of fish winterkill during favorable conditions, the fish population may be subject to consistent change.  Shoreline property owners and surrounding land users within the watershed can maintain or improve water quality by protecting the existing abundance of natural shoreline, updating outdated or failing septic systems, using phosphorus free fertilizer (if needed) on surrounding lawns or crop land, utilizing crop farming practices that reduce run-off, limiting aquatic plant removal or disturbance, and limiting construction of impervious surfaces near the shoreline.</p>'

 Survey Date = '2004-06-28',  County Name = 'Aitkin', Lake Name = 'Townline' 
 Lake Clarity = '' 
 Narrative = '<p>Townline Lake is a small lake located in central Aitkin County approximately five miles south of Palisade. The lake is 61 acres in size and about 40 percent is less than 15 feet deep. Due to the lack of nutrient-rich soils in the lake's small watershed, the fertility of the lake is low and as a result, most of the fish species in the lake exhibit slower than normal growth rates and have a small mean length.Anglers fishing on Townline Lake will find a variety of panfish as well as largemouth bass and northern pike. The bluegill fishery has exploded over the last 10 years increasing from 13 fish per trap net in 1994 to an astounding 166 fish per trap net in 2004. The largest bluegill sampled was 9.5 inches but the mean size was a mere 5.2 inches in total length. There are many factors that could be contributing to the large increase in bluegill numbers including seasonal sampling variations, lack of predation, increased fishing mortality on large bluegills or simply favorable reproductive conditions.   Black crappie have declined in abundance over the years but are still above the third quartile ranking for lakes of this type. Black crappie over 10 inches were sampled and the mean size was 8.4 inches. Northern pike numbers have remained relatively stable over the years and in 2004 there were 6 fish per net with a mean size of nearly 22 inches. The largest individual pike captured in 2004 was 28.9 inches long.  Anglers are encouraged to release the large northern pike, largemouth bass and dogfish to increase predation on the stunted bluegills.  </p>'

 Survey Date = '2012-06-25',  County Name = 'Becker', Lake Name = 'Bad Medicine' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/02/2011 Clarity: 17' 
 Narrative = '<p>Bad Medicine is a four mile long, narrow, 800-acre, 84 foot deep, clear water lake located in northeastern Becker County and within the White Earth Indian Reservation.  The lake has steep slopes near shore and 36% littoral area.  The surrounding watershed (1,185 acres) is almost entirely covered by mixed hardwood and conifer forest.  Although the lake lies within the Mississippi River drainage, it has no outlet and is primarily groundwater fed.  Historical water clarity records from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) show a mean secchi disk reading just over 23 ft for Bad Medicine.  This oligotrophic lake has a trophic state index in the lower thirties.  Dissolved oxygen levels and cool-water areas within and below the thermocline are sufficient to support a two-story fishery.  A state-owned public access is located on the north shore off MN 113.  This scenic lake has experienced increasing shoreline development and 162 homes or cabins were counted around the shoreline in 2006, compared to 126 in 1996 and 16 in 1950.  A few of those present in the late 1990's were flooded by high water and abandoned or removed.   <br> 
 <br> 
This lake has experienced dramatic changes in its fish habitat and fish community in the last 35 years.  Regarded as a bass/panfish lake in the 1950's and 1960's, the lake is now managed primarily for rainbow trout and walleye, although smallmouth bass have made a strong comeback in recent years. <br> 
 <br> 
Changes to the lake have come about primarily as a result of two natural events along with fish stocking and shoreline development.  First, in the late 1960's, the lake's aquatic vegetation was virtually eliminated by a population explosion of native crayfish.  Without nesting and cover habitat, bass and sunfish populations were not able to sustain their abundances.  Rainbow trout were introduced in 1977 in an attempt to control crayfish.  During the 1990's, increased precipitation led to rising water levels in this groundwater influenced lake.  Rising water not only flooded some lakeshore homes, it made additional areas available for northern pike spawning. <br> 
 <br> 
Even though northern pike are not considered abundant in Bad Medicine, net catches have increased since water levels have risen.  Pike not only grow relatively fast but also have the potential to grow large in the cool, well-oxygenated waters of this lake.  The presence of nutritious forage fishes like cisco and rainbow trout add to that potential.  Young pike (age two) dominated the population in 2012.  This accounts for the mean pike length of 21.6 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Rainbow trout are stocked annually as yearlings.  Trout angling has become extremely popular on this lake since they were introduced.  A study in the 1980's showed that, due to heavy angling pressure, very few trout survived to a second year in the lake and that stocked fish less than eight inches long were particularly vulnerable to natural mortality (probably pike predation).  Consequently, trout stocking size was increased to larger yearlings.  Also in 1998, in attempt to provide some larger trout to anglers, one fourth of the annual trout stocking complement of 16,000 rainbow trout was switched from spring stocked Madison strain yearlings to late fall stocked Kamloops strain yearlings.  With the closed winter season, fall stocked fish have time to grow before the angling season opens.  No creel survey has been done since 1998, but, several anglers have reported catching more trout weighing over two pounds since the change.  However, trout sampled in June 2012 were all yearlings averaging 13.4 inches in length. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleyes are also a popular angling target in Bad Medicine.  There is little natural reproduction of walleyes in the lake and the population is generally maintained by stocking.  Bad Medicine's fingerling stocking rate was increased to approximately 1.6 pounds per littoral acre in 2000 and to 2.0 pounds in 2006.  Fingerling stocking occurs biennially.  Walleye fry have not been stocked since the mid 1970's.  No evaluation of fry stocking success was made at that time.  Good survival of walleye fingerlings stocked in 2002, 2003, and 2004 resulted in the historic high test net catches in 2006.  Due to the large proportion of young fish, the average walleye length in 2006 was 13.5 inches. Walleyes sampled in 2012 averaged 15.3 inches and 1.2 pounds, but were less abundant at 3.8 fish per net.  Walleyes are known to grow large in this lake.  A 17 lb. 3 oz. fish was caught during the summer of 1993. <br> 
 <br> 
The yellow perch forage base has declined markedly since 2001.  Perch catches in Bad Medicine dropped to a new historic low of 0.7 per net in 2012.  Walleye growth rates appear to have slowed as a result.  The increasing smallmouth bass population may be impacting perch numbers and possibly walleye numbers and growth, as well.  There is a chance that smallmouth bass may be impacting crayfish abundance, too, as crayfish catch rates were down about 65% in 2012 compared to 2006. <br> 
 <br> 
DNR scuba divers reported seeing all sizes of smallmouth bass in 2005 and in 2006 smallmouth bass were caught in test nets for the first time since 1961.  Gill net catches increased from 0.7 smallmouth bass per set in 2006 to 1.89 per set in 2012.  An additional 17 smallmouth bass were sampled by spring electrofishing.  The average overall length of those sampled in 2012 was 13.4 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
This scenic lake is still going through a major transitional period.  The loss of vegetation, large swings in the abundances of various fishes, initiation of trout stocking, expansion of walleye stocking, increasing smallmouth bass population, increased shoreline development, and fluctuating water levels will continue to affect the evolution of the lake and its fish community for some time to come.  Following shoreline best management practices is particularly important in groundwater controlled lakes like Bad Medicine.  Nutrients that enter the lake essentially stay in the lake, adding to the lake's fertility and the aging process.  Buffer zones of natural vegetation, well maintained septic systems, and other good stewarship methods can help to sustain the lake's water quality, fish populations, and property values.  The Bad Medicine Lake Association and Bad Medicine Lake Foundation have proposed research grants via the MPCA to study various relationships of water quality indicators and subsequent protection of water quality in this land-locked, oligotrophic lake.</p>'

 Survey Date = '2016-06-13',  County Name = 'Becker', Lake Name = 'Bijou' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/13/2016 Clarity: 6.25' 
 Narrative = '<p>Bijou Lake has a history of providing fair to good fishing for panfish, bass, Northern Pike, and Walleye between winterkills. It is a relatively shallow and eutrophic lake, though severe winterkills have been rare. However, heavy winterkill mortality did occur in 1994, moderate mortality in 2001, and light mortality in 2004. Historical net catches also suggest that winterkill occurred sometime between 1964 and 1978. Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and Bluegill have survived without stocking after winterkills.  <br> 
 <br> 
In 2016, catch rate for Northern Pike was 8.5 fish per gill net which is within what is expected for similar lakes. Northern Pike size was good with fish averaging 4.1 pounds and 26.0 inches, and fourteen sampled fish were over 30 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
Catch rate for Black Crappie was 1.2 fish per trap net, and fish were moderate in size with an average length of 8.5 inches.  Six years is required before Black Crappie reached 10 inches long. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill catch was greatly reduced by winterkill in the 2001 survey. Though by the time of the 2006 survey Bluegill catch had rebounded to within what is expected for similar lakes, and it has remained there since. In 2016, sampled Bluegills ranged from 3.2 to 8.8 inches with a mean length of 6.1 inches.  Bluegill that were 8 inches long were around 7 to 8 years old.   <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye fry are stocked annually. Despite over three decades of stocking, Walleye gill net catch rates have remained consistently low in Bijou Lake compared to similar lakes around the state. However, gill net catch rate in 2016 reached a historical high of 2.0 Walleyes per net. Although Walleyes were not abundant, those sampled averaged 20.1 inches. </p>'

 Survey Date = '2012-06-18',  County Name = 'Becker', Lake Name = 'Buffalo' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/18/2012 Clarity: 12.9' 
 Narrative = '<p>Buffalo Lake has a diverse fish community that ranges from warmwater species like largemouth bass and bluegill to coolwater species like walleye and northern pike to coldwater species like tullibee (cisco).  With increased shoreline development and angler mobility, fishing pressure has likely increased in Buffalo Lake as it has in most Minnesota lakes.  The fishery remains strong with good numbers of northern pike, walleye, and bluegill, along with modest populations of largemouth bass and black crappie. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike are generally small, averaging just over 20 inches, but a good range of sizes up to 34 inches was found.  Also, a larger portion of sampled pike over 24 inches in length was found in 2012 than in any prior assessment (18%).  Good pike spawning habitat can be found in and near the lake via the Buffalo River. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye spawning habitat is much less abundant in Buffalo Lake.  Consequently, the walleye fishery is supplemented by fingerling stocking.  Buffalo was identified as a lake that might benefit from increased walleye stocking based on several factors including poor natural reproduction, a previously strong yellow perch forage base, and increasing fishing pressure.  The stocking rate was doubled to two pounds of fingerlings per littoral acre every other year beginning in 1998.  The increased stocking strategy has not resulted in expanded fishing opportunities for walleye in Buffalo Lake.  In fact, catch rates declined in 2002 and 2007.  However, it should be noted that the northern pike (a predator and comptetitor of walleye) catch rate increased to its historical high for this lake in 2007 and it remains relatively high in 2012 at 9.8 pike per net.  Walleyes sampled in test nets in 2012 averaged a respectable 1.6 pounds each.  Net catches were somewhat higher than the lake's long term average at 5.4 walleyes per set. <br> 
 <br> 
Panfish populations were dominated by bluegill.  Bluegill test net catches remained relatively high for this lake at 38 fish per net.  These fish averaged 6.8 inches in length and approximately 16% of sampled bluegills were longer than eight inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Lakeshore and watershed property owners can help to slow the aging of the lake (eutrophication) by using the best management practices available.  These practices include (1) exceeding setbacks for structures and septic systems, (2) leaving buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shoreline, (3) leaving vegetation stands (especially bulrush and cattail) intact, (4) and minimizing fertilizer and other chemical use in the watershed.</p>'

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/30/2008 Clarity: 7.2' 
 Narrative = '<p>East LaBelle is a relatively shallow, fertile, prairie lake located in western Becker County along the northeastern outskirts of Lake Park, MN.  The lake's fish community is typical of many lakes that winterkill occasionally.  For the most part, fish growth rates are average or faster. <br> 
 <br> 
In 2015, gill net catches of Walleye were 2.5 fish per set, which is close to average for East Labelle Lake.  Walleyes averaged 18.0 inches and 2.3 pounds.  Size of Walleyes ranged from 12.0 to 23.4 inches.  As in many winterkill lakes, the growth rates for Walleye were considered faster than normal with Walleyes reaching an average length of 17.6 inches in four growing seasons.  Walleye abundance in East Labelle Lake is maintained by stocking, with fry being stocked annually since 2010. <br> 
 <br> 
The 2015 Northern Pike catch rate was 15.8 per gill net, which was the second highest recorded since 1964.  The size range for northern Pike was 14.2 to 33.9 inches.  The average Northern Pike size was 22.1 inches and 2.9 pounds.  Northern Pike also exhibited fast growth rates with an average length of 23.7 inches by four years of age.   <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch were sampled near the lake's average of 42 per gill net.  Average size of Yellow Perch was 6.9 inches and ranged from in length from 5.4 inches to 10.1 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
After 20 years of relatively low and stable trap net catches, Bluegill catches were 98.3 per set in 2015, which was well above the lake's historical average of 17.4 Bluegills per trap net.  The average Bluegill length was 6.0 inches and lengths of sampled fish ranged from 3.3 to 9.4 inches.  Young fish dominated the Bluegill sample with four year old or younger fish comprising over 70% of the total catch. <br> 
 <br> 
Moderate numbers of Largemouth Bass were also present, ranging in size from 7 inches to almost 17 inches in length.  Although Black Crappie were not sampled in 2015, angler reports during the survey indicated there can be good fishing for them. <br> 
 <br> 
Like many lakes that occasionally winterkill, this one has an abundance of black bullheads that could be of interest to some anglers.  Most black bullheads were around nine inches long, though some larger bullheads (up to 11 inches) were also found. <br> 
 <br> 
With continuing shoreline and watershed development, this fishery will need help on several fronts to be sustained.  Anglers can help to maintain balance in fish populations by voluntarily releasing a portion of medium and large fish and keeping smaller ones for eating.  This is particularly true for Northern Pike and Bluegill.  Shoreline owners and other watershed dwellers can help to maintain or improve water quality and fish habitat by leaving shoreline buffer zones, by leaving stands of native aquatic vegetation intact, by taking precautions to prevent invasive species introductions, and by using wise land management practices.  </p>'

 Survey Date = '2013-06-24',  County Name = 'Becker', Lake Name = 'Ida' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/24/2013 Clarity: 9' 
 Narrative = '<p>Lake Ida has historically been known as a Northern Pike, bass, and panfish fishery with occasional good Walleye fishing, as well.  Due to the lack of high quality Walleye spawning habitat, fingerlings are regularly stocked to supplement the fishery.  Other species reproduce naturally and are not stocked.  Bluegills and Northern Pike have been particularly prolific in Lake Ida.  Test net catches of both species were higher than their historical averages in 2013.  Bluegills were particularly abundant, though smaller than the past. <br> 
 <br> 
It is likely that Northern Pike numbers were aided by high water levels since 1997.  High water made available more areas with preferred spawning habitat for pike.  A few large pike (over 30 inches long) were found in test nets, but the average size was considerably smaller at 23.4 inches in length and 2.1 pounds in weight.  Voluntary release of Northern Pike greater than 24 inches may help control the overabundant pike population and improve the health of the whole fish community. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegills averaged 6.2 inches and very few over eight inches were sampled.  Growth rates for Bluegill were slower than those in the average Minnesota lake.  Anglers should keep in mind that it takes about eight or nine years to grow an eight-inch Bluegill in Lake Ida.  Releasing a portion of the larger fish and keeping some of the smaller ones for eating can help to maintain a more balanced population. <br> 
 <br> 
The Walleye catch rate (7.0 fish per set) also increased and was higher than the lake's historical average of 5.9.  Walleyes in Lake Ida are generally good-sized with an average length of 18.7 inches and average weight of 2.4 pounds. <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie were also present in higher numbers than normal for Lake Ida.  Young and small fish dominated the samples of both species.  Crappies over 10 inches in length were very rare. <br> 
 <br> 
Ecologically, the lake is categorized as eutrophic which means it is quite fertile and productive.  Lakeshore and watershed landowners should be concerned about the lake becoming more fertile and aging prematurely.  Water quality should always be considered when doing shoreline landscaping, mowing, building, installing septic systems, etc.  Several good sources of information are available for shoreline landscaping in ways that do the least damage and have the greatest benefit to the lake's water quality, fish community, and property values.  Two of these are "Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality" and the computer CD "Restore Your Shore" which are both available through the Minnesota Bookstore.</p>'

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/20/2016 Clarity: 8.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>A standard survey was completed on Little Floyd Lake in 2016, beginning on June 20, 2016, using standard survey gear, including gill nets and trap nets.  Little Floyd Lake has a diverse fish community that includes not only warmwater and coolwater species like bullhead, Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Walleye, but also coldwater species like Cisco (Tullibee).  A special regulation for Northern Pike has been in effect on Little Floyd Lake since 2003.  This regulation requires anglers to immediately release all pike between 24 and 36 inches in length.   <br> 
 <br> 
The Northern Pike population in Little Floyd Lake is higher than the historical average.  Mean length of pike sampled during the 2016 assessment was 20.8 inches.  The percentage of pike sampled that were larger than 24 inches (13.4%) is less than sampled during the 2011 assessment, but still above historical average.  After 13 years, the pike population shows indications of improvement in the size structure of the population, but the results are not dramatic.  The average length of sampled Northern Pike has increased with the regulation in place, and there have been more Pike over 24" Pike present than before the regulation was in place.   <br> 
 <br> 
Tullibees and other coldwater species require cool, well-oxygenated refuge areas during the heat of summer and reasonably good water quality.  Significant declines in catch rates of coldwater species can signal problems with water quality.  Tullibee catch rates have declined during the last three surveys, and are currently at a historical low catch rate of 0.17 per gill net.  One Tullibee was sampled in 2016, with a length of 16.7 inches.    <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye fry are stocked annually in Little Floyd, and some limited natural reproduction may occur.  Walleyes are a modest part of Little Floyd's fishery, and catch rates have been within normal range of lakes with similar characteristics.  In 2016, Walleye catch rates were near the historical average for the lake, at 5.0 per net.   Average length of fish sampled in 2016 was 16.0 inches, and fish up to 23.5 inches were sampled. <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth Bass catch rates were above the historical average for Little Floyd, with an average length of 10.7 inches.  The Bluegill catch rate has declined since the population peak in 2006.  The current catch rate of 31.9 was below the historical average for Little Floyd.  Average size of Bluegills sampled was 5.5 inches, and some fish over 9 inches are present.   Trap net catch rates of Black Crappie were near the historical average for Little Floyd, with 0.33 fish per net.  The average crappie size was 8.0 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Fish populations in any lake are reflections of their habitat and watershed.  Little Floyd Lake and its surrounding watershed are heavily developed and the lake is vulnerable to cultural eutrophication (premature aging), due to high surface runoff and increased nutrients coming into the lake.  Following shoreland regulation established by the DNR, PCA, Becker County, and the Pelican River Watershed District can help ensure that the water quality and overall health of Little Floyd Lake withstands the environmental pressure within the watershed.   <br>

 Narrative = '<p>Although Meadow Lake has the capability of supporting both cold water and warm water fish species, it is no longer managed as a two-story fishery.  Both Rainbow and Brown Trout were stocked regularly from 1987 through 2009 with very limited success.  Meadow Lake functions naturally as a pike/bass/panfish lake.  Biennial Walleye fry stocking was initiated in 2010 in attempt to provide a modest fishery for this species, as well.  A few additional years of stocking are required to evaluate the success of the Walleye stocking, but early indications are that Walleye survival has been very poor and the lake remains best suited for Largemouth Bass, Bluegills, Black Crappies, and Northern Pike. <br> 
 <br> 
Test nets in 2014 showed continued strong catch rates of Northern Pike and low catches of cold-water species  such as Tullibee and trout.  The Northern Pike catch per gill net was near the historic high at 11.0 per net in 2014.  The average pike weight was 1.8 pounds and length was 20.2 inches.  No Brown or Rainbow Trout were collected in 2014 test nets.  A few, large Cisco (Tullibee) were sampled once again. <br> 
 <br> 
Other species present in Meadow Lake and sought by anglers include Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Black Crappie.  Bluegills are relatively abundant with a wide range of sizes present.  Bluegills over eight inches are not abundant, but can be found, and there are good numbers from seven to eight inches in length.  The Black Crappie sample was strong in numbers, but predominated by young, small fish.  A relatively strong 2012 year class may provide good crappie opportunities in the future.  Largemouth Bass catches were consistent with historical Meadow Lake catches and slightly higher than normal compared to other lakes of the same ecological classification. <br> 
 <br> 
Aquatic vegetation (especially bulrushes and cattails) should be protected on this small lake.  Shoreland developers and landowners should use practices that preserve water quality, fish populations, and property values.  Small lakes tend to be particularly vulnerable to development-related pressures and the eutrophication process.</p>'

During the height of the boating season, Becker County operates a tramway for transporting boats over the dike on the west shore to and from Lake Sallie. The heaviest fishing use comes from shore anglers along Dunton Locks County Park lands. The lake is shallow and fertile and aquatic plants often grow to the surface in even the deepest waters (19 feet) by mid-summer.  <br>

Bluegills and other sunfish are very abundant in Muskrat Lake. Most are not particularly large but can provide fast action. Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, bullheads, and an occasional Northern Pike add to Muskrat Lake's fishery. Walleyes and Muskies are rare, but have been found in the lake at various times. Walleyes, Northern Pike, Muskies, Lake Sturgeon, and many other species have been observed migrating upstream from Lake Sallie through the riffle where an impassable dam formerly stood. <br>

 Narrative = '<p> Shell Lake is a large, shallow, fertile lake that is subject to occasional winterkills.  Some winterkill was observed in 2014 that reduced populations of Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Walleye.  As a result, 136 Black Crappie adults, 720 Bluegill adults, and approximately 3.4 million Walleye fry were stocked into Shell Lake in spring of 2014.   Each of these species has now been reestablished, and the 2016 assessment catch rates confirmed the winterkill was not 100% and good recovery of most species has occurred.  Natural immigration is also possible via the Shell River, Shell Lake's outlet stream.  Extensive stands of wild rice are found in shoal waters throughout much of the lake, and waterfowl hunting is an important recreational use of the lake. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleyes sampled in the 2016 assessment averaged 19.4 inches in length and 3.0 pounds in weight.  Catch rates were near the historical average for Shell Lake, at 2.9 per net.  Walleyes from eight year classes were sampled, and the population appears to have rebounded following the winterkill of 2014. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill catch rates remained relatively high, well above the historical average for Shell Lake, at 36.1 per net.  Young Bluegills were most abundant, but some over eight inches were also found.

 <br> 
A high population of young, relatively small Northern Pike was present.  Catch rates for Northern Pike were well above the historical average for Shell Lake.  The size range of Pike sampled was between 9.2 inches and 34.4 inches, with an average length of 20.1 inches, and an average weight of 2.0 pounds.   <br> 
 <br> 
Carp, White Sucker, Bowfin, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow and Brown Bullheads were also found in standard gill nets and trap nets during the 2016 study.  Carp are likely immigrants via the Shell River.  No Black Bullheads were sampled during the 2016 assessment, following a steady decrease in catch rates since the 2000 assessment.  Yellow and Brown Bullheads are present, with average lengths 9.5 inches and 11.6 inches, respectively.   <br> 
 <br> 
Fish populations in any lake are reflections of their habitat and watershed.  Shell Lake and its surrounding watershed are primarily forested, yet increased development may put the watershed at risk for increased surface runoff and increased nutrients coming into the lake.  Following shoreland regulation established by the DNR, PCA, and Becker County can help ensure that the water quality and overall health of Shell Lake withstands the environmental pressure within the watershed.   <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2007-06-11',  County Name = 'Becker', Lake Name = 'Town' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/18/2007 Clarity: 4.75' 
 Narrative = '<p>Town Lake is a relatively shallow, eutrophic lake that is subject to partial winterkills of some fish species.  Even though dissolved oxygen levels dropped to critical levels throughout much of the lake during harsh winters in 1993, 1994, and 1996, the fish community structure did not reflect any severe, recent winterkill.  It is likely that year round inflow from Acorn Lake provided a refuge area for some fish during the stressful periods. <br> 
 <br> 
Test netting during June, 2007, continued to show abundant populations of bluegill, pumpkinseed, northern pike, and yellow bullhead.  Bluegills were more abundant than in the 1997 study but smaller and slower-growing.  The average bluegill was under six inches, but several over seven inches were found.  Northern pike averaged 21.1 inches and 2.24 pounds each.  Pike up to 28.5 inches long were caught.  Northern pike grow fairly rapidly in Town Lake, but not as fast as in 1997 when there were higher numbers of their preferred forage, yellow perch.  Perch catches declined since ten years ago and the average length was 6.6 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie were also sampled in test nets but most were relatively small and young.  Since black crappies are difficult to sample in standard mid summer test net gear, it is not known whether larger, older crappies are suspended over deeper water or are simply harvested as soon as they reach "keeper" size.  Walleyes were not sampled but anglers reported occasional catches, especially several years ago. <br> 
 <br> 
Other species sampled in test nets included bowfin (dogfish), largemouth bass, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, all three species of bullhead, and white sucker.  In eutrophic, winterkill-susceptible lakes, black bullheads commonly outnumber yellow bullheads because black bullheads are more tolerant of low dissolved oxygen and poor water quality.  Town Lake is an exception in that few black bullheads were found compared to the abundant yellow bullheads. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike and panfish populations appear to be in ample supply for a productive fishery in Town Lake.  While some winterkill is nearly inevitable in this shallow, fertile lake, fishing can be good "in between" winterkills.  Landowners can help keep not only fish populations, but also property values and water quality high by using the best land management practices available.  Voluntarily exceeding shoreline setbacks for buildings and septic systems, not fertilizing lawns (or using phosphorus free fertilizers), leaving wide shoreline zones of unmown natural vegetation, limiting the amount of shoreline exposed to cattle activity, and leaving as much aquatic vegetation (especially emergents like bulrushes and cattails) intact as possible when obtaining access to open water can help to slow eutrophication (aging) of the lake. <br>

 Survey Date = '2014-06-23',  County Name = 'Becker', Lake Name = 'Turtle' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/23/2014 Clarity: 14' 
 Narrative = '<p>Turtle Lake is a small (187 acres), deep (73 feet), heavily-developed lake located on the boundary between Becker County and Clay County.  The lake has been primarily regarded as a bass and panfish lake, although Northern Pike and Walleyes are also present.  Along with fluctuating water levels, the fish community in this groundwater influenced lake has been impacted by fishing pressure, fish stocking, water chemistry, and fish habitat changes. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike were stocked often in the 1960's and 1970's.  None have been stocked here since 1989.  The population sustains itself through natural reproduction in the spawning area just north of the lake. Pike over 30.0 inches long were not found in 2014 and the average length of sampled Northern Pike was just under 19.0 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye spawning habitat is lacking in Turtle Lake but fingerling stocking has helped to sustain a fishable population.  Only Walleyes have been stocked during the past two decades.  The lake was identified 15 years ago as one that might benefit from increased stocking.  The Walleye stocking rate was doubled to two pounds of fingerlings per littoral acre, biennially, in 1999.  Increased Walleye stocking has not resulted in increased catch rates.  In fact, the 2014 Walleye catch rate was the second lowest in history.  The potential cause is predation due to the dramatic increase in pike numbers.  Pike catches increased to a historic high in 2014 and Yellow Perch and Walleye populations have been detrimentally impacted.  In 2014, sampled Walleyes averaged a relatively large 19.3 inches in length and 2.7 pounds in weight. <br> 
 <br> 
Abundant, slow-growing Bluegills have been reported as part of Turtle Lake's fish community since the initial fisheries survey in 1947.  In 2014, the average length of Bluegills sampled in trap nets was 6.9 inches.  Several fish over eight inches were found and growth rates were only slightly slower than normal compared to statewide age and growth indices. <br> 
 <br> 
Despite permitted, private stocking of 3,000 Black Crappie yearlings in 2013, no crappies were caught in test nets.  However, several were caught while electrofishing in May, 2014.  They averaged 9.3 inches in length and none were younger than age four.  Previously, crappies were found in large numbers in Turtle Lake during only two surveys-the 1975 and the 1982.  Crappies are known to benefit from more turbid water conditions than most other gamefish and panfish species.  Interestingly, water clarities were significantly lower in Turtle Lake during the 1970's and early 1980's than in more recent years.  Algal blooms were reportedly more common then as well. <br> 
 <br> 
Fish populations in any lake are reflections of their habitat and watershed.  Turtle Lake's diverse fish community continues to reflect relatively good water quality.  There are very few Black Bullheads, a species that is favored by turbid water.  Turtle Lake and its surrounding watershed are heavily developed and the lake is vulnerable to cultural eutrophication (aging).  Unchecked development of this watershed could tip the balance toward smelly algal blooms and a fish community dominated by bullheads.  Lakeshore owners have not only battled against high water levels, but also for good water quality.  Landowners are encouraged to apply "best management practices" in order to maintain property values, water quality, and fish populations.</p>'

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2012-08-06',  County Name = 'Becker', Lake Name = 'Upper Cormorant' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/06/2012 Clarity: 4.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Upper Cormorant is a popular, all-around fishing lake located in southwestern Becker County.  This 856-acre lake is part of a chain of lakes that has been affected by high water levels during recent years.  Two narrow channels that may not be navigable during lower water years connect Upper Cormorant Lake with Rossman Lake and Nelson Lake to the east.  Upper Cormorant has a diverse fish community that offers anglers a variety of fishing opportunities. <br> 
 <br> 
Top predators include northern pike, walleye, and largemouth bass.  Pike were present in numbers typical for this lake.  Although northern pike growth rates are good in Upper Cormorant, few large pike were found.  Eighty percent of sampled pike were age three or younger.  Test net catches of walleye were near the lake's historical average at 7.9 per set in 2012.  The average weight of a sampled walleye was 1.5 pounds.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked in this lake annually to supplement very limited natural reproduction. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegills and black crappies are also common.  Although bluegills are somewhat slow growing in this lake, there were enough older fish present to provide opportunities to catch good numbers of bluegills over seven inches in length.  The black crappie sample was comprised of fish from several year classes, but none was particularly strong compared to the others.  The average size of Upper Cormorant crappies was 8.5 inches or a little under a half pound.  Some crappies over a pound were also found. <br> 
 <br> 
Information provided by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and this survey indicates that Upper Cormorant is eutrophic.  This means that the lake is fertile and productive.  However, an increasing trophic state also increases algal blooms and decreases water clarity.  The aging rate of a lake can increase with shoreline development and certain watershed uses.  Lakeshore and watershed property owners help to slow the aging process and protect water quality by using shore land best management practices.</p>'

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2012-06-04',  County Name = 'Becker', Lake Name = 'Waboose' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/04/2012 Clarity: 10' 
 Narrative = '<p>Waboose is a small, shallow, moderately fertile hardwater lake located in north central Becker County within the upper reaches of the Otter Tail River watershed.  Waboose Lake and its immediate watershed are contained entirely within the Tamarac National Wildlife Refuge, which maintains its relatively undisturbed character.  Water leaving Waboose flows west to Lower Egg Lake, then south via the Egg River to Flat Lake, eastward to the Otter Tail River, southwest to the Red River and eventually north to Hudson Bay. <br> 
 <br> 
Waboose is one of 15 area lakes in ecological class 39.  The shallow nature of class 39 lakes makes them susceptible to periodic, partial winterkill, often leading to "boom or bust" fish population cycles.  However, Waboose has not experienced severe winterkill for at least 27 years.  The lack of winterkill has resulted in continued low catch rates of bullhead and increased catches of several species of gamefish and panfish. <br> 
 <br> 
Waboose has little, if any, walleye spawning habitat, although forage and other conditions are favorable to sustaining a walleye population.  Consequently, stocking has been used to maintain a walleye fishery in this lake.  With the abundant forage base and lack of successful, walleye natural reproduction, Waboose was selected as a lake that could benefit from increased stocking rates.  In 1998, fingerling stocking rates were doubled to two pounds of walleyes per littoral acre (464 pounds) biennially.  The lake management plan calls for an aggressive goal of at least 7.0 walleyes per test net (the lake's historical average is 4.4).  Despite increased walleye stocking, the most recent study showed a decline in catch rates from 8.8 walleyes per set in 2007 to 1.3 per set in 2012.  However, it should be noted that northern pike, black crappie and bluegill catch rates increased over the same time period and at least one of those species may be having a detrimental effect on walleye numbers (likely pike). <br> 
 <br> 
During the late 1980's and early 1990's, Waboose was noted for its prolific crappie fishery.  Test net catches of this fish species dropped quite low during the past two assessments but have begun to rebound in 2012 with three moderate to strong year classes sampled.  Crappie sizes ranged from 2.6 to 10.7 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
In general, the fish community in Waboose Lake is typical of a lake that is subject to infrequent, partial winterkill.  Northern pike, black crappie, and yellow perch have survived without stocking.  Bluegills and largemouth bass have recently increased in number (possibly due to mild winters) and stocked walleyes help provide a fishery between rare winterkills.  Waboose also has an abundance of pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish, yellow perch, and white suckers.  Bluegills and largemouth bass were stocked in the past but did not establish strong populations until just recently.  Good numbers of 7-8 inch bluegills, 8-10 inch crappies, and 15-23 inch northern pike were all found in 2012.</p>'

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2013-08-13',  County Name = 'Beltrami', Lake Name = 'Julia' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/13/2013 Clarity: 6.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Lake Julia is a 450 acre lake with a maximum depth of 43 feet and water clarity around 6.5 feet.  The public access has a dock and concrete ramp and is on the north side of the lake off of County Road 26.  There is room for about 8 trucks with trailers; however, the state of the ramp makes launching a large boat challenging but still possible.  The nearest town is Puposky which is about 10 miles north of Bemidji just west of County Hwy 15.  Shoreline development primarily consists of a moderate number of private homes and lake cabins.  The Mud River flows in from Crane Lake and exits on the north side into Puposky Lake and eventually makes its way north to Lower Red Lake.  Historically, minor algal blooms are common in the summer giving the water a light green color; however, healthy oxygen levels are generally only reduced beyond depths of 18 feet by the end of summer.  Lake Julia is primarily managed for Walleye and secondarily managed for Northern Pike and Yellow Perch.   <br> 
 <br> 
Stocking records for Lake Julia go back to 1908 when Brown Trout, Black Crappie, Lake Trout, Sunfish, and Walleye were introduced to enhance the resident fish community.  Northern Pike were stocked sporadically from the 1950's through the late 1970's alongside Walleye.  However, since 1982 only Walleye fry have been stocked at a frequency of 2 out of 3 years and most recently at a rate of 1,500 fry/littoral-acre.  Currently, the fish community in Lake Julia consists of Black and Brown Bullhead, Black Crappie, Bluegill, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Yellow Perch, and most notably Walleye.  Lake Julia is becoming an ever more popular Walleye lake because of the abundance of "eater" sized fish with plenty of opportunity to catch one much larger. <br> 
 <br> 
The Walleye population is doing well with the average fish weighing about 2.2 lbs at a length of 17.7 inches.  Gillnet catch rates were down from 11.9 fish/net in 2003 to 9.9 fish/net in 2013 but average size has increased.  It appears that the majority of the Walleye population is dependent on supplemental stocking but the presence of year classes from non-stocked years indicate a notable amount of natural reproduction is occurring.  In fact, the most recent strong year classes observed were 2009, 2010, and 2011(2010 was not a stocking year).   <br> 
 <br> 
The Northern Pike population in Lake Julia is expanding.  In 2013, gillnets caught 13.7 fish/net, the highest catch rate since 1983.  Even though catch rate is up, average size has remained at 21.3 inches in length and 2.1 lbs with the majority of pike falling in the 18-24 inch range.  Successful spawning is attributed to Mud Creek connecting to Crane and Puposky, shallow lakes with dense aquatic vegetation and abundant prey species, ideal for Northern Pike recruitment.  The small size structure is likely attributed to harvest since comparable lakes with protective size regulations have measurably better size distributions.  <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch are very abundant with over 600 captured during the 2013 assessment and sizes ranging from 5 to 12.5 inches.  Average length is around 7.25 inches but larger fish are abundant and easily targeted.  <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegills are also noteworthy with over 65 captured and sizes reaching 8.5 inches.  They were first recorded in Lake Julia in 2003 so it is believed that both their abundance and size structure are still expanding.  Black Crappies were also first discovered in the early 2000's and were captured with lengths recorded over 11 inches in 2013.  While these new arrivals may add diversity to the fishery, new species introductions may have unintended consequences.  The simple fish community dominated by Walleye, Yellow Perch and Northern Pike has responded exceptionally well to Walleye fry stocking for decades.  As these new species continue to expand they may alter the conditions that made that management action so effective.  Hopefully Walleye will remain as the primary managed species as long as fry stocking continues to produce a healthy, fast growing, and well-structured population.  <br>

 Survey Date = '2014-06-24',  County Name = 'Benton', Lake Name = 'Little Rock' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/24/2014 Clarity: 4.1' 
 Narrative = '<p>       Little Rock Lake is the largest lake in Benton County.  Though large and close to a major metropolitan area, the lake's development and recreational value has been limited by poor water quality. Severe algal blooms have historically occurred in mid to late summer, which affect both the recreational value and fish community diversity.  At the time of the 2014 survey in mid-June the secchi disk reading was 4.1 feet which was better than usual for the time of year.  Little Rock Lake is a popular destination when Walleye season opens but by early June, few boats are found on the lake after algal blooms begin. The lake likely receives more fishing pressure during the winter season than summer.  <br> 
       The lake has limited vegetation due to poor water clarity.  Four feet was the deepest any vegetation was found to grow.   Filamentous algae was more common than any aquatic plant species when documenting vegetation diversity in August.   The most common shallow water substrate was sand.   <br> 
       A broad connection to the Mississippi River has some influence on the fish species composition in the lake as many of the species found are associated with riverine conditions.  Lack of vegetation and turbid water make the lake less suitable for Largemouth Bass and Bluegill.  Due to its shallow nature, Little Rock is one of the first lakes to freeze over in the area and fishermen are quick to take advantage of this targeting Walleye and Black Crappie.  Little Rock also warms up rapidly in the spring making it a good season opener destination.  Walleye natural reproduction maintains the population in the lake and for the most part has been successful at meeting fishing pressure demands.  The Walleye gill net catch rate was below management goals and low when compared to similar type lakes.  Occasional strong year classes appear to sustain the Black Crappie population.  Most crappie caught in surveys and reported "hot bites" are of similar sized fish.  The Northern Pike catch was also low when compared to similar type lakes and most of the fish caught in the survey were small by most anglers' standards.  An occasional large pike is caught in spring sampling and ice fishing also. <br> 
      Channel Catfish are quite common and averaged 21 inches or about four pounds in the survey and are rarely targeted by anglers.  All three species of bullhead are known to inhabit Little Rock Lake.  Brown and Yellow Bullhead were the two species caught in the 2014 survey and abundance appears to be low for both.   Species in the sucker family found in Little Rock Lake are White Sucker, Shorthead Redhorse, Silver Redhorse, and Bigmouth Buffalo.  Common Carp were also caught in the summer survey and abundance appears to be within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes.  Carp bowfishing has become increasingly popular and Little Rock Lake has an abundance of shallow flats to accommodate the sport. Yellow Perch numbers showed a significant improvement from the last survey.  Although most anglers consider perch to be nuisance when fishing, the species can be an important food species for most game fish.       <br> 
        Improving the water quality in Little Rock Lake has been a goal of an active lake association as well as local government and state agencies. Work has been done with landowners in the watershed to reduce nutrient run-off to streams feeding the lake. The Benton County Soil and Water Conservation District is conducting a TMDL (Total Maximum Daily Load) study on the lake to identify nutrient sources and needed remedies. <br>

 Survey Date = '2016-08-15',  County Name = 'Blue Earth', Lake Name = 'Loon' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/15/2016 Clarity: 2.8' 
 Narrative = '<p>Introduction <br> 
Loon Lake is an 809 acre lake in Blue Earth County east of the city of Lake Crystal. Loon Lake is a hypereutrophic, shallow lake with a maximum depth of 7.0 feet. A DNR- maintained public access is located on the south side of the lake off of County Road 9. Although some of the shoreline has been altered for residential development, most of the riparian zone is intact and stands of natural vegetation, like bulrush and cattails, are present. During the winter, Loon Lake is aerated to help prevent fish kills. Use caution when traveling on the ice, as aeration systems can create open water and thin ice. Despite aeration attempts, Loon Lake experiences periodic winterkills, the latest being in 2014 when a partial and selective winterkill occurred. Loon Lake is classified in Lake Class 43 based on lake characteristics. Other lakes in this classification include Gorman Lake (Le Sueur County), Phelps Lake (Rice County), and Rice Lake (Faribault County). Loon Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie, Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, Channel Catfish, and Bluegill. To maintain the Walleye population, Loon Lake is stocked with Walleye fry every other year at a rate of 1,500 fry per littoral acre (even years). In the event of a winterkill, adult species, such as Walleye (adult and fry), Northern Pike, Channel Catfish, Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Yellow Perch, are stocked to re-establish the fish community. Due to the shallow depth and tendency to winterkill, Loon Lake is managed as a "boom and bust" fishery. In the 2-3 years following a winterkill, fish populations have a "boom" effect where abundance soars as the stocked fish fill empty niches within the aquatic ecosystem. Additionally, these stocked fish have a tendency to grow very fast since there is abundant food resources and limited competition. This phenomenon is accompanied by "bust" years of fish abundance immediately after a winterkill occurs. <br> 
 <br> 
Loon Lake was surveyed the week of August 15, 2016 by the MN DNR as part of a regularly scheduled monitoring program. This survey included deploying 4 gill nets and 10 trap nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. Loon Lake is scheduled to be surveyed again in 2022. <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye <br> 
Walleye were sampled in the 2016 gill nets at a rate of 15.8 fish/net. This catch rate was below the long-term average for Loon Lake (29.6 fish/net). Historically, the Loon Lake Walleye population has varied greatly depending on timing of winterkill events. The lengths of Walleye from both gear types averaged 10.6 inches and ranged from 8.3 to 14.3 inches, which suggested a small size structure. As the size structure suggested, the Walleye population was young. All fish were age-1 (stocked in 2015) or age-2 (stocked in 2014). The average length at capture was 9.2 inches at age-1 and 11.7 inches at age-2. These growth rates are slower than the statewide average for the same lake classification. Walleye were recently stocked in Loon Lake in 2014, 2015, 2016. The MN DNR will continue to stock Walleye fry on even years.  <br> 
 <br> 
Crappie Species <br> 
The 2016 survey sampled 2 species of crappie, the Black Crappie and White Crappie. The Black Crappie catch rate was 74.2 fish/trap net, which was the highest catch rate on record for Loon Lake and was above the long-term average of 24.6 fish/net. Gill nets also sampled Black Crappies at a rate of 18.5 fish/net, which was also above the long-term average for Loon Lake of 17.5 fish/net. The size structure of Black Crappies was fair, with an average length of 8.1 inches and a maximum length of 12.4 inches. Ages ranged from 0 to 7 years old. Most of the aged fish (76%) were age-2 or younger. The average length at capture was 6.3 inches at age-1, 8.1 inches at age-2, and 10.1 inches at age-6.  <br> 
 <br> 
White Crappies were sampled in trap nets at a rate of 1.8 fish/net and in gill nets at a rate of 0.3 fish/net. This was the first survey that documented the presence of White Crappies. The length of White Crappies averaged 8.9 inches, which suggested a quality size structure. All of the White Crappies were age-1 or age-2. The average length at capture was 7.8 inches at age-1 and 9.4 inches at age-2. Crappies are stocked only after winterkill events.  <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike <br> 
The 2016 Northern Pike catch rates were 0.8 fish/gill net and 0.7 fish/trap net, which were both near the long-term averages for Loon Lake (0.9 fish/gill net and 0.6 fish/trap net). The lengths of Northern Pike from both gear types averaged 23.1 inches and the largest fish measured 34.0 inches. Although the catch rate was low, the size structure was fair. Ages ranged from 1 to 4 years old. The average length at capture was 18.0 inches at age-1, 19.2inches at age-2, 25.7 inches at age-3, and 33.6 inches at age-4. Northern Pike are not stocked in Loon Lake unless a severe winterkill occurs. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch <br> 
Yellow Perch were sampled at a rate of 6.8 fish/gill net. The long-term average for Loon Lake is 19.4 fish/gill net, but the catch rate has not been higher than 10.2 fish/net since the 1980s. The average length of Yellow Perch in 2016 was 8.3 inches and the largest fish was 11.3 inches, which suggested a quality size structure. Ages ranged from 1 to 6 years old and 72% of all aged Yellow Perch were age-1. The average length at capture was 7.7 inches at age-1, 9.5 inches at age-2, and 11.0 inches at age-4. Yellow Perch are not stocked in Loon Lake, so the population persists through natural reproduction. Among all game fish species, Yellow Perch are one of the most tolerant of low dissolved oxygen, which makes them ideal management species in lakes with winterkill potential.  <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill <br> 
The 2016 Bluegill catch rate was 2.5 fish/trap net, which was below the catch rate of the previous survey in 2006 (11.1 fish/net) and below the long-term average of Loon Lake of 8.1 fish/net. The average length of Bluegills was 5.5 inches and the range was 4.3 to 8.5 inches. Ages ranged from 1 to 5 years old. The average length at capture was 4.8 inches at age-1, 5.6 inches at age-2, 8.2 inches at age-4, and 8.5 inches at age-5. Historically, the Bluegill population has remained low in Loon Lake. Bluegills have not been stocked in Loon Lake, but were stocked in nearby connected Crystal Lake in 2015. Thus, the Bluegill population exists from either natural reproduction or migration from Crystal Lake.  <br> 
 <br> 
Other Species <br> 
Black Bullheads were the most common fish species in the 2016 survey. A total of 959 fish were sampled between gill nets (105.3 fish/net) and trap nets (53.8 fish/net). The average length of Black Bullheads was 9.0 inches. Historically, the Black Bullhead population has varied greatly, ranging from 121.0 fish/net in 1987 to 6.2 fish/net in 2001. Yellow Bullheads were also sampled in the 2016 survey at rates of 4.0 fish/trap net and 0.8 fish/gill net. The average length was 8.9 inches. The Yellow Bullhead population in Loon Lake has persisted at low abundance throughout survey history. Common Carp were present in the survey, but have not been present in high numbers in Loon Lake since the late 1980s and early 1990s. Other species sampled in the 2016 survey included White Sucker, Golden Shiner, and Hybrid Sunfish.  <br> 
 <br> 
Angling Summary <br> 
Loon Lake should continue to provide quality angling opportunities between winterkill events. Although Walleye abundance was high, the average length at the time of the 2016 survey leaves plenty to be desired. The crappie populations were very strong in 2016 and many anglers have been taking advantage of this "boom" fishery. Also notable was the Yellow Perch, which exhibited modest abundance, but extremely fast growth rates.   <br> 
 <br> 
Anglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> 
 <br> 
Shoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2009-07-27',  County Name = 'Carlton', Lake Name = 'Cross' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/27/2009 Clarity: 3.25' 
 Narrative = '<p>Cross is a 101-acre lake with 100 acres (99%) of littoral area and a maximum depth of 23 feet.  Cross Lake is located 2.5 miles north of Cromwell, Minnesota off Highway #73.  Cross Lake has a gravel, back-in access off the Highway #73 right-of-way on the east end of the lake.  Cross Lake was survey during the summer of 2009 as part of an effort to evaluate the impacts of the aquatic macrophyte wateshield on local lakes and to update information on fish populations. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye abundance of 0.5 per gillnet lift had decreased since 2002 (0.8) and was still considered below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 19.8 inches was large and growth was fast.  Age analysis revealed five year-classes represented from 2000 through 2005. <br> 
   <br> 
Northern pike abundance of 1.5 per gillnet lift had decreased since 2002 (2.7) and was still considered below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 24.0 inches was considered large and growth was typical.  Age analysis revealed all year-classes from 2003 through 2007 were represented.   <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch, which had been sampled by gillnet from all previous investigations, were not sampled during the 2009 lake survey. Young-of-the-year and older yellow perch were sampled from seining conducted in 2009. <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie abundance of 1.1 per trapnet lift had decreased since 2002 (2.2) and had fallen to below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 7.3 inches was considered average and growth was slow.  Age analysis revealed all year-classes from 2001 through 2007 were represented with a relatively strong 2005 year-class.   <br> 
Bluegill abundance of 19.0 per trapnet lift was greater than 2002 (11.0) but still considered typical compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 4.4 inches was small and growth was slow.  Age analysis revealed consistent recruitment with all year-classes represented from 1999 through 2007 and a very strong 2007 year-class.    <br> 
Other fish species sampled include bowfin, Johnny darter, golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker and yellow bullhead.  <br> 
 <br> 
Information was collected on aquatic vegetation, substrate and water quality.  Diversity of aquatic plants was typical with 30 species or species groups identified along 10 transects.  Watershield, which was identified at 100% of the transects, was the most frequently identified plant.  Arrowhead group, sedge group, spikerush group and yellow waterlily group were also identified at greater than 60% of the transects.  Lakeshore residents around Cross Lake have reported a dramatic increase in the distribution and density of watershield in recent years.  In response, a special assessment of watershield was completed in conjunction with the 2009 survey.  An aerial photography analysis revealed that in 2003, 13.2 acres of Cross Lake was covered with watershield.  In 2009, 24.1 acres were covered with watershield, a 45% increase from 2003.  It is suspected that low alkalinity as well as longer, warmer growing seasons are contributing factors to the increase in watershield abundance.  Other lakes in the Duluth Area (Sand in Carlton County and Cooks in St. Louis County) with similar water chemistry are experiencing increases in the abundance of watershield.  The most common substrate type was sand, which was identified at 90% of the transects.  All other substrate types identified had frequencies of occurrence less than 50%. Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Cross is a slightly acidic (pH 6.4), soft water lake (alkalinity 5 ppm) with good fertility (total phosphorus 0.032). <br>

 Survey Date = '2009-06-29',  County Name = 'Carlton', Lake Name = 'Hizer' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/02/2009 Clarity: 3.1' 
 Narrative = '<p>Hizer is a 33-acre lake that has 100% littoral area and a maximum depth of 9 feet.  Hizer Lake is located 2 miles east of Mahtowa, Minnesota off County Road #139.  Hizer Lake has no public access and lies on an unnamed tributary to the Blackhoof River.  An initial survey was conducted on Hizer Lake to gather information on physical characteristics and the fish population.   <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike abundance was 3.4 per trapnet lift.  Average size of 16.9 inches was considered small and growth was typical.  Age analysis revealed consistent recruitment with all year-classes represented from 1999 through 2007. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch abundance of 0.7 per trapnet lift was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 6.9 inches was considered small but growth was fast.  Only two year-classes were present (2005 and 2006).  <br> 
  <br> 
Black crappie abundance of 10.7 per trapnet lift was well above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 6.1 inches was considered small and growth was fast.  All black crappie originated from the 2007 year-class. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill abundance of 1.2 per trapnet lift was slightly below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 5.3 considered typical and growth was fast.  Only two year-classes were present (2006 and 2007). <br> 
 <br> 
Other fish species sampled from Hizer Lake in 2009 include black bullhead, golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, tadpole madtom and white sucker. <br> 
   <br> 
Information was collected on aquatic vegetation, substrate and water quality.  Diversity of aquatic plants was low with 20 species or species groups identified along 10 transects.  Floating-leaf burred was the most frequently identified plant (100% of transects).  Sedges, spikerush, stonewort, swamp fivefinger and yellow waterlily were all identified at greater than 50% of the transects.   The most common substrate type was detritus, which was identified at 90% of the transects.  Gravel, rubble, sand and muck had frequencies of occurrence between 40 and 60%.  Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Hizer is a slightly alkaline (pH 7.2), soft water lake (alkalinity 22 ppm) with good fertility (total phosphorus 0.067 ppm). <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2014-07-21',  County Name = 'Carlton', Lake Name = 'Moosehead' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/21/2014 Clarity: 5.1' 
 Narrative = '<p>Moosehead is a 292 acre lake with 261 (89%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 18 feet.  The lake is located immediately east of Moose Lake, MN and has a city administered, concrete, back-in access.  A public swimming beach is adjacent to the access.  Moosehead Lake has not been actively managed with fish stocking since 1985.  Moosehead Lake was surveyed in 2014 to update information on fish populations and aquatic habitat. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye abundance of 1.7 per gillnet lift was down from 2006 (3.3) but still average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye abundance has ranged from 2.5 to 3.3 per lift during four previous investigations from 1972 through 2006.  Average size was 16.6 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Age analysis revealed inconsistent recruitment with six missing year-classes from 2002-2013. <br> 
 <br> 
Black Crappie abundance of 8.7 per trapnet lift was up from 2006 (1.7) and above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 8.6 inches was large and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Age analysis revealed a strong 2010 year-class and consistent recruitment with all year-classes from 2006 through 2012 represented. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill abundance of 8.4 per trapnet lift was up from 2006 (5.1) and above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size was 6.7 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Age analysis revealed strong 2007 and 2011 year-classes and all year-classes from 2005 through 2012 were represented. <br> 
 <br> 
A total of 5 Largemouth Bass were sampled with electrofishing equipment.  Bass electrofishing was not attempted in previous investigations but Largemouth Bass were sampled with regular assessment gear in 1977 and 1989.  The Largemouth Bass catch rate of 4.1 fish per hour of electrofishing on-time was below average compared to other Duluth Area populations.  Largemouth Bass average length was 15.8 inches.  Not enough individuals were captured to evaluate stock density or growth, but recruitment appears sporadic with two missing year-classes from 2004-2010. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike abundance of 6.0 per gillnet lift was down from 2006 (9.0) and average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size was 21.6 inches.  Northern Pike were not aged for this assessment. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch abundance of 11.0 was up from 2006 (7.0) but was still average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size was 6.1 inches.  Yellow Perch were not aged for this assessment. <br> 
 <br> 
Lake Sturgeon have been documented in gillnet samples from investigations conducted in 1989 and 1999.  There are also anecdotal reports of spawning activity in the Moosehead River near the Highway #61 Bridge at the outlet of Moosehead Lake.  Anglers have reported catching large Lake Sturgeon in Moosehead Lake.  No Lake Sturgeon were encountered during this survey.   <br> 
 <br> 
Other fish species sampled during this investigation include Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Shorthead Redhorse, Silver Redhorse, White Sucker and Yellow Bullhead.   <br> 
 <br> 
A substantial percentage (31%) of lakeshore homeowners on Moosehead Lake have open yards extending to the shoreline.  Lakeshore owners can prevent excessive nutrient loading which leads to excessive plant growth and poor water quality by avoiding lawn fertilization, limiting aquatic vegetation removal, and implementing riparian best management practices.  Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Moosehead is a slightly acidic, moderately hard water lake of low fertility. <br> 
 <br> 
Information was also collected on aquatic vegetation.  Thirty-five aquatic plant species or species groups were identified along 134 sampling points.  Water (wild) celery was the most frequently found plant (17% of stations sampled) followed by clasping-leaf pondweed (15%) and bushy pondweed (14%).  One invasive plant was identified at low abundance (reed canary grass) but this species is common in emergent wetland plant communities and has become well-established in Minnesota.  These data can be compared to future aquatic plant surveys of Moosehead Lake to estimate how the plant community may be changing.</p>'

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2010-07-26',  County Name = 'Carlton', Lake Name = 'Upper (North) Island' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/26/2010 Clarity: 9.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Upper Island is a 101 acre lake with 100 (99%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 25 feet. The lake is located just north of Cromwell, MN off State Highway #210 and has a DNR administered earthen, back-in access.  The designated access is off the County Road #120 right-of-way and has very limited parking.  Walleye fry have been stocked in even years from 2000 through 2010. Upper Island was last assessed in 2002.  Upper Island was surveyed during the summer of 2010 to update information about fish populations and to evaluate the success of the walleye stocking program.  <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye abundance of 0.3 per gillnet lift was down from 2002 (0.5) and was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye mean length was 19.8 inches but only 2 individuals were captured.  Not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.  Both fish were from the 2002 year-class.  Both walleyes aged corresponded to a stocked year-class. <br> 
 <br> 
A total of 19 largemouth bass were sampled with electrofishing equipment.  The catch rate of largemouth bass was 35.8 fish per hour of electrofishing on-time.  Largemouth bass average length was 15.0 inches and growth was fast compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 through 2009 were represented in the sample except 2007 and 2008.  Shoreline seining captured 2 young-of-the-year (YOY) largemouth bass with an average length of 2.4 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike abundance of 2.7 per gillnet lift was down from 2002 (7.3) and below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  The northern pike CPUE of 2010 is the lowest on record of seven investigations dating back to 1977.  Average length was 22.0 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 to 2009 were represented except 2004. <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie abundance of 1.6 per trapnet lift was down from 2002 (3.8) and was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length was 7.6 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2003 to 2008 were represented. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill abundance of 10.4 per trapnet lift was up from 2002 (3.1) and above average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of sampled bluegills was 5.8 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 to 2007 were represented.   <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch abundance of 0.2 per gillnet lift was up from 2002 (0.0) and was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Only one perch was captured and it was 6.5 inches in length.  Not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.  The one perch captured was from the 2007 year-class.    <br> 
 <br> 
Other fish species sampled included black, brown and yellow bullhead, bowfin, central mudminnow, mottled sculpin, tadpole madtom, common shiner, golden shiner, Johnny darter, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass and white sucker.    <br> 
 <br> 
Information was collected on aquatic vegetation, substrate and water quality.  Thirty-three aquatic plant species or species groups were identified along 10 transects.  Yellow water lily, coontail and flat-stem pondweed were the most frequently found plant species (90% of transects) followed by northern milfoil (80% of transects).  The most common substrate types were sand and detritus which were identified along 70% and 60% of the transects, respectively.  Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Upper Island is an alkaline, moderately hard water lake with low fertility. <br> 
 <br> 
Upper Island Lake was included in an index of biotic integrity (IBI) assessment in 2010.  In addition to standard gillnets and trapnets, beach seines and backpack electrofishing equipment were used to index species richness of the nearshore lake habitat.</p>'

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2013-07-08',  County Name = 'Carver', Lake Name = 'Bavaria' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/08/2013 Clarity: 5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Bavaria is a Class 24 lake located in eastern Carver County, near the town of Victoria.  This fertile lake is 162 acres, with a maximum depth of 66 feet. There is a county owned boat launch located on the southwest shore.  Lake Bavaria tends to stratify rather shallow; during the summer of 2013, dissolved oxygen fell below 3 ppm at 12 feet.  Evidence of low-oxygen conditions in limited areas (partial winterkill) was noted after the 2010-11 winter. <br> 
Bavaria is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass and secondarily for Northern Pike and Bluegill. In 2013, a population assessment was conducted, consisting of spring night-time electrofishing and trap netting, and summer gill netting. <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth Bass are abundant; however, few large fish were sampled.  The electrofishing catch rate, 74.5 per hour of active sampling ("on-time"), is high relative to other lakes in the West Metro area.  One hundred-thirty Bass were sampled, averaging 10.6 inches and 0.8 pounds.  The largest fish measured 21 inches.  Forty percent of the sampled fish were longer than 12 inches, and 5% were longer than 16 inches. Largemouth Bass in Lake Bavaria reach 12 inches by age 5 and 16 inches by age 9.  A detailed study of the Largemouth Bass population, covering the period 1992-2001, was conducted by MN DNR Fisheries Research; results are in MN DNR Fisheries Investigational Report 506. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike are highly abundant, and of quality size.  The gill net catch rate, 8.5 fish per net, has increased from the previous survey in 2007, when 3 fish per net were caught.  Although the fish are of quality size, averaging 25.4 inches and 3.9 pounds, 2013 mean size was lower than in 2007 (26.9 inches/ 4.1 pounds).  Ninety-two percent of 2013's catch was longer than 21 inches, and 25% were longer than 28 inches.  The largest fish sampled measured 34.3 inches. Northern Pike grow fast in Lake Bavaria, reaching 21 inches by age 3 and 29 inches by age 6. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill are quite abundant in Bavaria, and of quality size. Their abundance has been gradually increasing since 1990, when 37.4 fish per net were caught. The 2013 trap net catch rate, 80.8 fish per trap net, is similar to the previous survey in 2007 (79.3 fish per trap net).  Average size has increased, from 5.4 inches and 0.11 pounds in 2007 to 6.4 inches and 0.2 pounds in 2013.  Seventy percent of the sample was longer than 6 inches, and 40% were longer than 7 inches. Ages 1 through 9 were present in the sample.  Bluegill growth is average in Lake Bavaria, with fish reaching 6.5 inches by age 4 and 7.5 inches by age 6.   <br> 
 <br> 
Black Crappie were caught at a rate of 10.7 per trap net in 2013, which is moderately high for this type of lake.  Fish averaged 8.2 inches and 0.27pounds, with the largest fish measuring 9.8 inches.  Ages 2 through 8 were represented in the sample and growth rate appears average relative to statewide averages.  Fish reached 8.1 inches by age 4.   <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Bullhead were very abundant, and the majority of fish sampled were over 10 inches in size.  <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2008-07-21',  County Name = 'Carver', Lake Name = 'Eagle' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/21/2008 Clarity: 1' 
 Narrative = '<p> Eagle Lake is a 233-acre, class 43 Lake located in western Carver County near the city of Young America.  Eagle Lake is shallow (maximum depth: 14 feet) and highly eutrophic.  Eagle Lake is similar to the other nearby lakes and is best characterized as a boom-bust lake.  Angler attention is primarily focused towards the cyclic black crappie population, particularly during the winter months.  Winter angling effort can be very high when the black crappie population is high, and very low when the black crappie population is down.  In recent years black crappie size has remained small and angler effort has been low.  Walleye and tiger muskellunge are stocked into Eagle Lake, although they receive proportionately less attention.  Prolific algal blooms and high water temperatures can hamper summer angling.  Summer water clarity averages 1 foot, and dissolved oxygen levels at depths greater than 9 feet were insufficient to support fish at the time of this survey.  Two public accesses are found on the south and east shorelines.   <br> 
 <br> 
Trapnets and gillnets were used to sample the fish population of Eagle Lake during the third week of July 2008.  Twelve species were sampled with black crappie and bluegill dominating trapnet catches and black crappie dominating gillnet catches.  The black crappie trapnet (45.29 fish/net) and gillnet (209.75 fish/net) catches were the highest recorded since 1996 and exceeded the 75th percentile two-fold.  Black crappies were small, averaging 6.99 inches and 0.19 pounds.  Only twelve percent of sampled black crappie exceeded 8 inches while 1 percent exceeded 10 inches.  The largest black crappie sampled measured 12.24 inches.  Black crappie mean weight was just below and above the 25th percentile for trapnets and gillnets respectively.  Condition indices indicate black crappie were in fair condition, however condition declined significantly with length indicating a resource bottleneck affected larger individuals.  This relationship was evident during sampling, as smaller fish appeared to be in normal condition while larger fish appeared emaciated.  Black crappie recruitment in Eagle Lake appears to be inconsistent, a common phenomena in black crappie populations.  Five age classes (3-7) were represented in the black crappie catch, however an astonishing 97 percent (883) originated from the 2005 year-class.  Angling for black crappie has the potential to be excellent in 2-3 years if this large year class is able to overcome the resource bottleneck that affected larger fish at the time of this survey.  Black crappie growth was similar to other area class 43 lakes. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill trapnet catch (45.86 fish/net) was half that found in 2002, but was still more than double the 75th percentile.  Sampled bluegill averaged 5.6 inches, and 26 percent exceeded 6 inches.  The largest bluegill sampled was 7.5 inches.  Bluegill mean weight (0.2 pounds) was below the 25th percentile.  Condition indices indicate bluegills were in fair condition.  Similar to black crappie, bluegill condition decreased significantly with length indicating a resource bottleneck affected larger individuals.  Five age classes (2-6) were represented in the bluegill catch.  Bluegill growth was slower than other class 43 lakes in the area. <br> 
 <br> 
Previous assessments have sampled walleye in average to excellent abundance in Eagle Lake.  In 1996, the walleye catch exceed the 75th percentile at 26.5 fish/net.  This high catch was the result of excellent survival of stocked fry in 1994.  These fish averaged 11.1 inches at the time of the 1996 assessment.  This large year-class also contributed to the 2002 catch.  However, in 2008 the walleye catch was 1.75 fish/net.  Six walleyes from the 2001 year-class and 1 walleye from the 1994 year-class were sampled.  This indicates inconsistent survival of annually stocked walleye fry.  The large crappie population found in Eagle Lake is likely contributing to the inconsistent walleye fry survival.  However, when fry stocking is successful an excellent fishery can be created as evidenced by the 1996 assessment.  Sampled walleye grew fast, and growth was higher than other similar lakes. <br> 
 <br> 
Eight tiger muskellunge were sampled with an average length and weight of 37.4 inches and 13.51 pounds.  Tiger muskellunge grew fast and were in good condition.  Tiger muskellunge are stocked every three years. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2016-07-13',  County Name = 'Carver', Lake Name = 'Minnewashta' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/13/2016 Clarity: 5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Lake Minnewashta (DOW 10-0009-00) is a 738-acre, Class 24 Lake with a maximum depth of 70 feet. It is located in northeast Carver County in the City of Chanhassen. There are two boat launches located within a Carver County regional park. A fishing pier and short reach of shore access are available at City of Chanhassen's Roundhouse Park, on the lake's west shore. <br> 
 <br> 
Lake Minnewashta is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass (Special Regulation: catch-and-release-only) and Northern Pike. Lake Minnewashta supports additional game species, including Bluegill and Black Crappie. A standard survey (11 trap nets/9 gill nets) was conducted on Lake Minnewashta during the week of 7/13/16 to monitor water characteristics and fish populations. Lake Minnewashta is a productive eutrophic lake. Water clarity was 5 feet, with overall water color brown-green during the 2016 survey. Dissolved oxygen fell to zero parts per million at depths greater than 18 feet. The Lake Minnewashta Park beach was closed for a period in late September 2016 because of high E. coli bacteria levels. Zebra mussels were first discovered in Lake Minnewashta during summer 2016. <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth Bass in Lake Minnewashta have been managed under a Special Regulation-catch-and-release-only- since 1997.  Nighttime boat electrofishing sampled Largemouth Bass at a rate of 78.2/hour. The 2016 catch rate was the highest recorded on Lake Minnewashta, and more than double the previous high catch rate of 31.4/hour. A total of 189 bass were sampled during electrofishing, with an average length of 10.5 inches and the largest measured at 20.1 inches. Despite high abundance, body condition was good. Largemouth Bass reached 9.3 inches by age 3, indicating average growth when compared to the statewide Lake-Class average. Results from a 2015 voluntary creel survey found about 50 percent of angler caught bass were greater than 15 inches, while 1 percent of bass were greater than 20 inches. As of the 2016 survey results, Largemouth Bass populations were near long-range management goals and will continue to be managed under the Special Regulation. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike in Lake Minnewashta were very abundant, with gill nets catches (11.7/net) well above the expected rate. Northern Pike average length was 22.8 inches, with a maximum length of 31.7 inches. When compared to other lakes across the state, growth rates were above average, with an average length of 21.4 inches at age 3. Body condition was on the low end of the normal range. An abundance of spawning habitat in Lake Minnewashta allows Northern Pike to consistently reproduce, shown by 9 consecutive year classes recorded in age analysis. Results from the 2016 Lake Minnewashta survey show Northern Pike exceeding management goals by most measures. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill in Lake Minnewashta were abundant, with trap net catches (36.9/net) well above catch rates of similar lakes across the state. Bluegill were also sampled in unusually high numbers in gill nets (22.8/net), suggesting Bluegill are moving offshore during summer. Combining trap net and gill net catches, 583 total fish were caught; average length was 5.7 inches, with the largest measured at 7.9 inches. The 2016 survey results describe a population skewed toward small individuals. Despite high numbers of small fish, body condition was good. Bluegill growth was moderate, with an average length of 5.2 inches by age 3. <br> 
 <br> 
Black Crappie were sampled with gill nets (14.9/net) and trap nets (4.6/net), typical catch rates compared to similar lakes across Minnesota. Although Black Crappie catch rates in Lake Minnewashta were average compared to similar lakes, the 2016 catch values were the highest recorded on Lake Minnewashta. Combining trap net and gill net catches, 174 total fish were caught; average length was 7.0 inches with the largest measured at 12.4 inches. Body condition of Black Crappie was good; growth rates were normal compared to the statewide average, with an average length of 6.0 inches by age 3. Despite a high percentage of small fish in the catch, Lake Minnewashta has the potential to produce crappie greater than 12 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Other fishes sampled in low abundance were Black Bullhead, Bowfin, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Walleye, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch.</p>'

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2011-08-15',  County Name = 'Carver', Lake Name = 'Oak' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/15/2011 Clarity: 2.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Oak is a shallow, eutrophic, 339-acre lake located in northern Carver County near the city of Watertown.  It is primarily managed for northern pike and secondarily largemouth bass and bluegill.  The lake is occasionally stocked with walleye by a landowner who lives on the lake (with a permit from the DNR).  Oak lake is subject to periodic winterkill so a permit to aerate has been submitted by the landowner as well.  In August 2011, a population assessment was conducted to determine the size structure and abundance of game fish in the lake.   <br>

Walleye abundance is high (7.3/gill net) in Oak Lake, although the population seems to be aging.  In the 2005 assessment, catch averaged 26.7 walleye per gill net, and consisted of smaller younger age-3 and age-4 individuals averaging 15.4 inches and 2.0 lbs.  The current population is larger and older averaging 21.2 inches and 3.7 lbs.  The largest fish measured was 27.2 inches and 7.1 lbs.  Eighty-two percent of the walleye were 15 inches or longer, 52% were 20 inches or longer, and 23% were 25 inches or longer.  Walleye body condition was fair, with the larger fish being in better condition than the smaller.  Walleye were present from the 4 most recent stockings.  The majority (64%) of the population was comprised of age-10 individuals from the 2001 fry stocking. Walleye from the 2002 (9%), 2005 (7%), and 2006 (4%) year classes were also present.  Age-2 (11%) and age-3 (4%) walleye were present as well.  Walleye were not stocked in these years indicating illegal stocking may have occurred due to the low likelihood of fish migration or natural reproduction.  Age-2, 3 and 6, walleye grew fast, however growth was slow for all other year classes.  Walleye averaged 13.1 inches by age-2, 24 inches by age 6, and 21.6 inches by age-10.      <br> 
 <br> 
The northern pike population is moderately low for its lake type (2.3/gill net).  Pike have not been collected in high abundance since 1995 (when 10.3 per gill net were observed).  Winterkill has occurred since then and may explain the shift in population abundance.  In 2011, northern pike averaged 23.1 inches in length and 2.8 lbs, with the largest reaching 27.3 inches and 4.4 lbs.  Eighty-nine percent were 14 inches or longer and 78% were 21 inches or longer.  Northern pike displayed good body condition.  Ages ranged from 1 through 6, with 44% age 5.  Growth was average compared with statewide averages.    <br> 
 <br> 
Ten largemouth bass were collected during the assessment; however, passive sampling gears, such as trap nets and gill nets, are not effective methods for collecting largemouth bass.  The data presented for this species is not indicative of relative abundance or size structure.  Electrofishing is the typical method for largemouth bass assessments but was not conducted during this survey.  Despite this, in the nets we observed a large size structure.  Mean size was 14.8 inches and 2.5 lbs with the largest reaching 20.9 inches and 7.3 lbs.  Eighty percent were 12 inches or longer, 50% were 15 inches or longer, and 10% were 20 inches or longer.  A largemouth bass fishery is present in Oak Lake; however the population can't be fully determined from these net-based survey results.   <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie abundance was high in gill nets (68.3/net) and moderate in trap nets (7.9/net).  Catch in both gears was the highest it has been in recent assessments despite recent hard winters.  Average length and weight of all black crappie sampled was 6.6 inches and 0.22 lbs, with the largest measuring 10.2 inches and 0.52 lbs. Sixty-one percent were 5 inches or longer, 28% were 8 inches or longer, and <1% was 10 inches or longer.  Individual black crappie were in good condition with the smaller fish in better condition that the larger.  Ages ranged from 2 through 6, with age-2 (49%) the most represented.  The 2007 and 2008 year classes were equally as strong representing 20 and 19% of the population, respectively.  Growth was average for ages 2 through 4, but slow for ages 5 and 6.  Black crappie reached 6.9 inches by age 3 and 9.8 inches by age 6.  <br> 
 <br> 
The 2011 assessment represents a historical high in white crappie numbers sampled here; however, their abundance is considered moderately low (2.0/gill net, 2.3/trap net) for its lake type.  Size structure of white crappie was good.  Average length and weight from both trap nets and gill nets was 8.7 inches and 0.40 lbs, with the largest measuring 12.5 inches and 0.95 lbs.  Eighty-two percent were 5 inches or longer, 54% were 8 inches or longer, 54% were 10 inches or longer, and 4% were 12 inches or longer.  Body condition of white crappie was good, the smaller fish tended to be in better condition than the larger.  Ages ranged from 1 through 6, with all age classes well represented.  Growth of white crappie was fast compared to other similar West Metro Area lakes.  Fish averaged 8.2 inches by age 3 and 11.7 inches by age 5.   <br> 
 <br> 
Despite bluegill abundance being high (27.0/trap net), the catch was the lowest observed from all previous assessments.  However, since the 2005 assessment, mean weight has increased from 0.17 lb to 0.25 lb.  In 2011, mean length was 6.8 inches, with the largest measuring 8.1 inches and 0.41 lbs.  Size structure was skewed toward larger individuals.  Eighty-eight percent were 6 inches or longer and 0.4% were 8 inches or longer.  Individual bluegill condition was good, with the smaller fish in better condition than the larger.  Ages ranged from 1 through 8, with most year classes well-represented.  Growth was average for ages 1 through 4, then became slow for all older year classes.  Bluegill averaged 5 inches by age 3, 6.3 inches by age 5, and 7.3 inches by age 7. <br> 
 <br> 
There was an abundance of rough fish sampled in Oak Lake.  Black bullhead (104.3/gill net) and common carp (6.3/gill net) were common.  Other fish species sampled in low abundance were brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.     <br> 
 <br> 
An assessment of fish in the shallow, nearshore habitats was also conducted using backpack electrofishing and seining.  Five species were sampled which included bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, and yellow perch.  The purpose of the nearshore sampling is to calculate an Index of Biotic Integrity score.  An Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) is estimated based on all fish sampled in this assessment.  The absence of sensitive species such as minnows and darters contribute to a low IBI score.  Oak Lake scored 25.8 out of a maximum of 160, indicating possible water quality and habitat impairment.  <br>

 Survey Date = '2016-06-20',  County Name = 'Carver', Lake Name = 'Reitz' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/20/2016 Clarity: 6' 
 Narrative = '<p>Reitz Lake (DOW#10-0052-00) is a 79-acre, Class 30 lake with a maximum depth of 36 feet. It is located in central Carver County, southeast of Waconia. Reitz is actively managed as a panfish lake focusing on Black Crappie and Bluegill. Long-range goals aim to maintain Bluegill numbers above 60/net, while Black Crappie should produce numbers between 20-40/net. Secondary management species include Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass. A standard survey (9 trap nets/6 gill nets) was conducted on Reitz Lake during the week of 6/20/16 to monitor water characteristics and fish populations. Spring nighttime electrofishing was also completed to sample Largemouth Bass. Reitz is a small eutrophic lake, which during the survey had visible brown/green water with 6 feet of water clarity. Dissolved oxygen fell to 1.8 parts per million (ppm) at a depth of 12 feet, and 0 ppm at greater depths, during the late-June 2016 sampling period. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill numbers in Reitz Lake were low, sampled at 4.4/trap net, and the lowest since the 1993 survey (2.2/net). Despite historically low catch rates, size structure was well above management expectations. Of the 51 Bluegill measured in gill and trap nets, fish averaged 6.9 inches with the largest individual measuring 9.7 inches. Body condition values were at an all-time high and well above average values. Growth of Bluegill was also fast compared to other metro lakes, with an average length of 7 inches at age 3. Despite low numbers of Bluegill, the population has responded with increased growth, body condition, and a more favorable size structure. <br> 
 <br> 
Black Crappie in Reitz Lake were abundant in the 2016 survey. Trap net (14/net) and gill net (30.8/net) catches were high when compared to similar lakes across the state. There were 300 total Black Crappie netted between gill and trap nets, with an average length of 7.2 inches and maximum length of 11.0 inches. However, only a small proportion were of quality (>8 inches) size. Despite low numbers of quality fish, body condition values were high. Growth was also fast with an average size of 8.5 inches by age 3. In addition, there is a large year class of age-2 fish that made up the bulk of the catch, averaging 7 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike were sampled with gill nets at 8.0/net, a high catch rate compared to similar lakes across the state. The 2016 catch rate was the highest recorded on Reitz Lake, and more than double the previously high catch rate of 3.5/net. Average size of Northern Pike was 23.4 inches with the largest measured at 30.7 inches. Body condition values were normal. Growth of Northern Pike was moderately fast, with an average length of 23 inches at age 3. Seven consecutive year classes were identified during aging, suggesting consistent recruitment among years. The 2016 survey results suggest Northern Pike in Reitz Lake had consistent recruitment, good abundance, average condition and size. <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth Bass were sampled during spring 2016 with nighttime boat electrofishing. This was the first year Largemouth Bass had been targeted with electrofishing. 62 total bass were sampled with a catch rate of 29.7/hour. Average size of Largemouth Bass was 11.4 inches with the largest measured at 18.7 inches. Although average size was small, the proportion of fish greater than 15 inches was high. Growth rates were moderate, with an average length of 9.5 inches by age 3. Natural recruitment was consistent, shown by 10 consecutive years without a missing age class. <br> 
 <br> 
Other fish species sampled in low abundance were Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, Yellow Bullhead, and Yellow Perch. In addition, 43 Freshwater Drum were sampled with an average length of 15 inches, and the largest measuring 19.4 inches. <br>

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/22/2015 Clarity: 3.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>A DNR Fisheries Standard Survey was conducted on July 22nd, 2015, at Riverpointe Pond in Watertown, MN (Carver County).  Riverpointe was formed from abandoned gravel pits that collected water; water body formation in this way results in the unique Class 33 categorization for a locality characterized by fertile, soft-bottomed lakes.  This 5.7-acre pond has been managed by the Fishing in the Neighborhood (FiN) program since 2007 and is regularly stocked with Bluegill sunfish, Largemouth Bass and Channel Catfish.  Riverpointe Pond is conveniently located alongside the South Fork of the Crow River and was first surveyed in 2008. <br> 
 <br> 
Species that are present in Riverpointe Pond and are of interest to anglers include Bluegill sunfish, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Channel Catfish and Black Bullhead.  Bluegill abundance was below average for this lake class and had a mean length of 7.3 inches. Black Crappie abundance was also below average for this Lake Class and had a mean length of 7.8 inches. The most abundant species sampled was Black Bullhead, which averaged 7.6 inches in length and weighed an average of 0.24 pounds.  Nine Northern Pike were captured during the survey and ranged from 19.3-29.1 inches in length and averaged 3.14 pounds. Other fishes sampled in low abundances were Channel Catfish and Yellow Bullhead. <br> 
 <br> 
Riverpointe Pond is surrounded by a city park that the City of Watertown is continuing to improve by adding more walking paths, a fishing pier, picnic tables and gazebo.  <br>

 Survey Date = '2016-08-08',  County Name = 'Carver', Lake Name = 'Waconia' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/08/2016 Clarity: 6' 
 Narrative = '<p>Lake Waconia (DOW 10-0059-00) is a 2,996-acre, Class 27 Lake with a maximum depth of 37 feet. It is located in north central Carver County, just north of the city of Waconia. DNR-owned public access is provided on the east end of the lake. Several other public access points and shore-angling locations, along with a marina with pay access, are also present. <br> 
 <br> 
Lake Waconia is primarily managed for Walleye (special regulation: 16 inch minimum length) and Muskellunge.  It is one of only two lakes in the DNR West Metro Fisheries Area (the other being Lake Minnetonka) that have had evidence of Walleye natural reproduction.  Amounts and consistency have been insufficient to produce a steady, desirable walleye fishery.   Since 2015, Muskellunge fingerlings (830 fish) are stocked annually in the fall. Walleye have recently been stocked in a cycle of three out of four years with fry (830,000 fish), and the fourth year with fingerlings (1,660 pounds).  Results from the 2016 survey indicated this Walleye stocking plan may not be maximizing the return.  Beginning in 2017, Lake Waconia will be fingerling-stocked at 1 pound per littoral acre (1,660 pounds) biennially.  Secondarily managed species in Waconia include Largemouth Bass and Bluegill.  Lake Waconia supports other game fish including Black Crappie and Yellow Perch. <br> 
 <br> 
A standard survey (12 trap nets/10 gill nets) was conducted on Lake Waconia during the week of 8/8/16 to monitor water characteristics and fish populations. Lake Waconia is a productive eutrophic lake. Water clarity varied between 4.5 and 6 feet between the two sampling sites, while overall water color was brownish green throughout. Dissolved oxygen dropped to 0 parts per million in depths greater than 30 feet during the sampling period.  The Lake Waconia Regional Park beach was closed for a period in late September 2016 because of high E. coli bacteria levels. Zebra Mussels were discovered in 2014. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye numbers in Lake Waconia were low, with gill nets catches at 2.7/net- numbers well below average when compared to similar lake types across the state. The 2016 Lake Waconia catch rate was the lowest recorded since 1988. From 2009 through 2015, only two year classes of Walleye appeared in gill net catches, both corresponding to fingerling-stocked years. These results prompted a change in Walleye stocking; beginning in 2017, fry stocking will be dropped in favor of every-other-year Walleye fingerlings. Despite multiple missing year classes, Walleye average size was desirable at 16.9 inches, with the largest measured at 22.1 inches. Body condition of these individuals was on the low end of the expected range. Changed Walleye-stocking plans- based on fingerling stocking- should help recruitment problems caused by successive years of fry stocking and/or little evidence of recent natural reproduction. <br> 
 <br> 
Muskellunge are not effectively sampled with the gear used in the summer fisheries survey. However, incidental catch occurred on 1 Muskellunge in trap nets (32.7 inches) and an additional 1 Muskellunge in gill nets (21.1 inches). Future surveys will include targeted ice-out Muskellunge sampling.  Angler reports, muskie-fishing-guide effort, and Metro Muskie Tournament results reflect establishment of a viable, consistent Muskellunge fishery with a desired size structure. <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth Bass are present in Lake Waconia, although boat electrofishing was not conducted in 2016. Incidental catch captured 16 Largemouth Bass in trap and gill nets, with an average length of 10.7 inches and a maximum length of 17.8 inches. Results from a 2013 voluntary creel survey found about 45% of Largemouth Bass caught were greater than 15 inches, while 5% were greater than 20 inches. Future surveys will include spring Largemouth Bass sampling. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill numbers in Lake Waconia were high, with 34.8/net. Average size of Bluegill in trap nets was 6.4 inches, with the largest measured at 8.3 inches. Bluegill averaged 5.7 inches by age 3; however, Bluegill are not reaching 7 inches until age 6, indicating slow growth. Body condition values were low, and likely contributed to slow growth rates. Despite low condition and slow growth, Bluegill are consistently reproducing and recruiting to the population. <br> 
 <br> 
Black Crappie in Lake Waconia were abundant, with trap net (3.1/net) and gill net (9.5/net) catches high when compared to similar lakes across the state. Average size of Black Crappie sampled during 2016 was 8.3 inches with a maximum length of 9.7 inches. Body condition and growth rates were average, with a mean length of 8 inches at age 4. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch numbers in Lake Waconia were extremely low, with 1.1/gill net. This was the lowest-ever value recorded.  There were several missing year classes, reflecting poor recruitment. Yellow Perch body condition was also poor, the poorest observed since this value was recorded. Despite low abundance and poor condition, growth was moderate, with an average length of 6.5" by age 3. <br> 
 <br> 
Other fishes sampled in low abundance were Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, Golden Shiner, hybrid sunfish, Northern Pike, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead.</p>'

 Narrative = '<p>Loon is a 237 acre lake located about three miles southwest of Pequot Lakes.  A public access is present on the southeast shore.  The lake has moderately hard water, low phosphorus fertility and good water clarity.  Aquatic plants are generally abundant and grow to a depth of about 18 feet.  About 90% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  Partial winterkills have occurred in more severe winters.  A pump-and-baffle aeration system is used to reduce the impact on the lake's fish population.A partial winterkill occurred in 1993-'94.  As a result, the fish catch in the summer, 1994, sampling was probably reduced.  Northern pike were present in "average" numbers compared to similar type lakes.  Age 2-5 fish were sampled and most were from the 1992 or '93 year classes.  Northern pike growth was good.  Largemouth bass were only sampled in shoreline seine hauls.  Walleye catch was "low" for this type of lake.  Bluegills were present in "average" numbers in 1994.  Ages 3-6 were sampled and growth was slow.  About 20% of measured bluegills were at least 7.0 inches long.  Pumpkinseeds and black crappies were found in "low" numbers compared to similar lakes.

There was a township-owned public access located on the southwest corner of the lake, off of CSAH No. 1.  Maximum water depth is 39 feet and about 35% of the surface area is less than 15 feet deep.  It is a hardwater lake with low phosphorus fertility.  Water clarity was about average for area lakes in 1997.The aquatic plant community was fairly diverse in 1997.  Emergent species are important for controlling nutrient levels and minimizing shore erosion caused by wave action.  Species like  bulrush enhance the quality of spawning habitat for largemouth bass and several panfish species.  Wild rice can provide additional spawning habitat for northern pike.  Submerged and floating leafed species provide food and cover for a wide variety of aquatic species.Test netting was conducted in summer, 1997.  The catch of tullibee was in the "high" category when compared to similar type lakes.  Catches of northern pike, walleye and bowfin (dogfish) were in the "low" category.The northern pike catch was "low" in '97, however catches have been "low" in three of the five nettings done on this lake.  The walleye catch was also in the "low" category.  Stocking was discontinued in '93.  Eighteen year of stocking, using a variety of fish sizes, failed to produce a satisfactory walleye fishery, as measured by gill net catch.  Largemouth bass were caught in "average" numbers, similar to past catches.Bluegill numbers dropped into the "average" category, after being in the "high" category in three of the previous four nettings.  Eight age classes were sampled and growth was slow.  The strongest year classes were from 1992 and 1994.  About 17% of measured bluegills were 7.0 inches or more in length in 1997.Yellow perch were absent from gill nets but were caught in "average" numbers in trap nets.  Tullibees were present in "high" numbers and most fish were 16-18 inches long.  Past tullibee catches have all been in the "high" category.  White sucker, another important forage species was caught in "average" numbers.  Other species sampled in "97 included "low" numbers of bowfin (dogfish) and black bullhead.

The maximum depth is normally 17 feet, but extremely high water levels in 1999 have increased the water level by 4 feet.  Water clarity is good for the area.  Shallow water soils are predominantly sand.  Emergent aquatic plants, especially bulrushes provide preferred spawning sites for panfish and bass.  Marshy areas are important for northern pike spawning.  Submerged plants grow to a depth of 8 feet and provide protection and feeding areas for a variety of fish species.Gamefish found in 1999 netting included northern pike, walleye and largemouth bass.  Pumpkinseeds were the only sunfish found in the lake.  Black crappies were present as well.  Northern pike were found in average numbers compared to similar lake types.

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/11/2006 Clarity: 10' 
 Narrative = '<p>Three Island Lake is a 173-acre lake located near Longville, MN. The lake has 7.52 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 13 feet. Ninety percent of the shoreline is undeveloped woodland, 5% is cropland or pasture, and 5% is bog. A U. S. Forest Service-owned public access is located on the northeast side of the lake. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MN DNR) has classified Minnesotas lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical, chemical and other characteristics. Three Island Lake is in Lake Class 37.  Class 37 lakes are small, shallow, eutrophic lakes best suited for bass and panfish. <br> 
 <br> 
Three Island Lake offers good opportunities for anglers seeking northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill in a pristine setting where most of the shoreline is public land. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike are abundant, but generally run small. Average size was 19.82 inches and 1.74 pounds, with the largest northern pike sampled measuring 29.1 inches in length and 5.3 pounds. <br> 
 <br> 
Most of the largemouth bass sampled were small, with an average length of 10.7 inches, however fish up to 17.9 inches in length are present.  <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill are abundant, but generally small. The average length of bluegill sampled from all gear was 5.2 inches. Fish over 8 inches in length are uncommon.  <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie numbers are near average for this lake class. The average length of sampled fish from all gear was 8.0 inches and lengths ranged from 4.2 to 12.6 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
Other species available to anglers are yellow perch and pumpkinseed.  <br> 
 <br> 
Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Three Island Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.   <br> 
 <br> 
Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesotas lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cant support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  <br> 
 <br> 
Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants and natural lake bottom soils. <br> 
Plants in the water and at the waters edge provide habitat, prevent erosion and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife.</p>'

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/04/2014 Clarity: 3.3' 
 Narrative = '<p>Chisago Lake is a moderately fertile 873 acre lake located in southern Chisago County bordering Chisago City.  The lake is broadly connected to South Lindstrom Lake by a natural channel.  The two lakes are somewhat physically different with South Lindstrom having a smaller percentage of littoral (water less than 15 feet deep) acreage (42%) than Chisago (80%). The channel allows fish to migrate freely between the two lakes. Because past surveys and assessments dating back to 1956 indicate similar fish composition and abundance, the two lakes are considered one for management purposes. Currently, the primary management species are Walleye and Largemouth Bass. <br> 
 <br> 
The Chisago chain of lakes, which also includes South Lindstrom, North Lindstrom, North Center, and South Center, has a history of extreme water level fluctuations. These fluctuations, up to 7 vertical feet, are believed to be due to a net loss of water to groundwater in the system, making the lakes dependent on long term cycles in precipitation.  Water levels increased in 2014 and were almost 4 feet higher than the low water levels recorded in 2009 and 2010. The water levels in 2009 were the lowest they had been in 40 years.   <br> 
 <br> 
Chisago-South Lindstrom Lake was selected for a special Largemouth Bass regulation due to a 1995 survey that found a high abundance of small bass in both basins. A 12-inch maximum size limit for Largemouth Bass was implemented in March 1997 and was based on the premise that angler harvest was limiting the size structure of the Largemouth Bass population. The long-range goal of the special regulation was to maintain a Largemouth Bass population with a modal length between 13 and 15 inches and an electrofishing catch rate greater than 110 per hour. Post regulation surveys have indicated that the overall population size structure of Largemouth Bass has improved. Nighttime spring electrofishing was conducted on May 28, 2014 to assess the current Largemouth Bass population. A catch rate of 192 fish per hour, was slightly less than the previous assessment in 2010, but was still the second highest catch rate observed in Chisago Lake. The modal length group of Largemouth Bass observed in the electrofishing assessment was 13 inches, and lengths ranged from 7.5 to 17.5 inches.  Currently, the Largemouth Bass population is meeting the objectives of the special regulation.   <br>

Walleye catch rates were down from the 2010 assessment to 2.9 per set with a mean weight of 3.3 pounds, but catch rates were still high when compared to similar lakes in Minnesota. Walleye lengths ranged from 14.1 to 25.7 inches with a mean length of 20.8 inches. Otolith data sorted the twenty-nine aged Walleye into six year classes, with most of the fish corresponding to years with fall fingerling stockings. The 2007 year class (stocked) accounted for 41% of the catch.  <br> 
 <br> 
The Northern Pike gill net catch, at 9.0 per set, was high when compared to similar lakes and up from 7.9 in 2010 and 3.3 in 2005. Mean weight was similar and remained high at 3.5 pounds. Northern Pike lengths ranged from 17.1 to 33.9 inches with a mean length of 25.1 inches. The oldest Northern Pike sampled was age-9 and 7 year-classes were represented with the 2009 year class making up 38% of the sample.   <br> 
 <br> 
Trap nets sampled Bluegill at 27.6 fish per set, which was slightly above average when compared to similar lakes. The mean weight, 0.21 pounds, was also slightly above average.  Bluegill lengths ranged from 3.3 to 8.0 inches with a 6.2 inch mean length. Bluegill 7 inches and greater represented more than 38% of the catch from both gear types, a good ratio for the Chisago Lakes Area. However, not many Bluegill exceeded 8 inches. Pumpkinseed abundance is also high and Pumpkinseed over 8 inches were more numerous than Bluegill over 8 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Black Crappie gill net catch rates declined for the fourth consecutive survey to 10.6 per net, but still remained high when compared to similar lakes. Mean weight, based on the trap net catch, was at a new high of 0.31 pounds, but mean weights in both gill and trap nets remained below average. Sampled Black Crappie lengths ranged from 4.0 to 12.2 inches and had a mean length of 7.1 inches, however only a few fish over 9 inches were observed.  <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch numbers declined from a long time high of almost 14 per gill net in 2010 to 3.2 per gill net during this assessment, which is below average when compared to similar lakes.  Golden Shiner catch rates increased to an all-time high of 9.5 per gill net, and likely provide another important forage for the lakes predator populations. <br> 
 <br> 
Quality fishing opportunities exist for most species in Chisago Lake.  At times fishing pressure on Chisago Lake can be high and anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help maintain and improve the quality of Chisago Lake's fishery. Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish. Releasing medium to large fish will help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future. The current Largemouth Bass regulation is a great example of this. This regulation protects larger fish, which has created excellent catch-and-release angling opportunities for Largemouth Bass larger than 12 inches, while still allowing for harvest of smaller fish. <br> 
 <br> 
Non-native invasive species of vegetation are present in Chisago Lake.   Eurasian Watermilfoil was first documented in Chisago Lake in the fall of 2009 and Curlyleaf Pondweed has been present since at least 1969. Anglers and boaters should take necessary precautions to prevent the further spread of invasive species. <br> 
 <br> 
Some shorelines of Chisago Lake are highly developed, which can put stress on the lake's aquatic habitat and ecosystem integrity.  Environmentally friendly development practices, such as shoreline buffer strips of natural vegetation, are encouraged to help maintain and improve the water quality of Chisago Lake.  Water level fluctuations in the Chisago chain of lakes can leave exposed sediments and if left alone, these areas will naturally vegetate and stabilize the shorelines on their own.  Also, if trees and branches have fallen in the water, consider leaving them where they are to provide important habitat for fish and wildlife that is often missing in highly developed lakes. <br>

 Narrative = '<p>Comfort is a relatively deep, medium sized lake of moderate fertility.  Located in southwestern Chisago County, the lake has a predominantly sandy shore with moderate development.  Water clarity is good for the area with a secchi disc reading of 10 feet on June 14th.  The lake is managed primarily for walleye and northern pike.  In the past, walleye fingerlings (135 pounds) were stocked biennially in the fall.  The stocking plan has recently been changed to an annual fall fingerling stocking of 90 pounds.   <br> 
 <br> 
As in previous samples, the electrofishing catch for largemouth bass (7.9 per hour) was dramatically lower than in nearby lakes.  The factor limiting bass abundance is still unknown, but it doesn't appear to be a lack of spawning habitat or available forage as both appear abundant.  The gill net catch for walleye and northern pike fell within the normal range compared to similar lakes.  Both showed modest increases compared to the 2005 catch.  Walleye ranged in length from 13.7 to 24.7 inches with a 20 inch and 2.8 pound average.  Although smaller walleye weren't sampled in the gill nets, many between 10 and 13 inches were observed during the bass electro-fishing and reported by walleye anglers.  Sampled northerns were quality sized ranging up to 30.9 inches with a third of the catch in excess of 25 inches.  The yellow perch abundance remains high.  Although most perch were too small to interest anglers, they do provide an important forage base for walleye and northern pike.  The black crappie catch was higher than expected but few, less than 10 percent, exceeded 8 inches in length.  Similarly, bluegill abundance was good but with few fish in excess of 7 inches, size may be an issue with anglers. <br> 
 <br> 
Comfort Lake's fish community also included banded killifish, black bullhead, bluntnose minnow, bowfin (dogfish), brook silverside, common carp, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, shiners (golden, spotfin, and spottail), Johnny darter, muskellunge, pumpkinseed sunfish, and white sucker.</p>'

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/22/2011 Clarity: 2.2' 
 Narrative = '<p>East Rush Lake is a large (1480 acre) lake in northern Chisago County. It is connected by a navigable channel to West Rush Lake, but the two lakes are very different in structure. East Rush is shallower, with a maximum depth of 24 feet, and more windswept. Algae blooms can result in low water clarity in late summer. The two lakes are managed primarily for Walleye, Muskellunge, and Northern Pike, with Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass as the secondary management species. A standard survey was conducted in 2015 using trap nets, electrofishing, and gill nets.  Overall, the fishing on East Rush Lake for many species should be quite good.  There are good numbers of Yellow Perch, Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Northern Pike.  <br> 
 <br> 
Walleyes were sampled at their lowest rate since 1992 and slightly below their historic average, but numbers were still within the normal range for this lake type.  A variety of sizes are present, with fish in excess of 28 inches present.  Although some natural reproduction takes place, the Walleye population is primarily a result of stocking efforts. <br> 
 <br> 
A 24-36 inch protected slot regulation for Northern Pike has been in place since 2005 on East Rush Lake, and was changed to a 26-40 inch protected slot in July of 2015. These regulations are intended to increase the numbers of larger pike.  Numbers of Northern Pike in the 2015 survey were normal for the lake type and higher than the historic average.  Northerns averaged 27.8 inches and 5 pounds, their highest since 1985.  It is hoped that the new, shifted protected slot limit will further improve the Northern Pike size structure while allowing anglers the expanded opportunity to harvest fish up to 26 inches in length.  <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth Bass, sampled by night electrofishing on June 9, were less abundant than the 2011 sample and some other Chisago County lakes. However, size was good with the majority of bass 12 inches in length or larger. <br> 
 <br> 
Black Crappies were again abundant with the gill net catch exceeding the norm for the lake class.  While roughly 10% of the catch approached 9 inches or better in length, crappies between 6.5 and 7.5 inches accounted for one-third of the catch.  This year class should provide good angling for the next several years.  Bluegill numbers were typical of the lake type.  Bluegill size was the largest recorded since the1985 assessment with 37% of the catch surpassing 7 inches.  Yellow Perch were abundant in both net types and provide a good food supply for larger predator fish as well as additional angler harvest opportunity.</p>'

 Narrative = '<p>Horseshoe Lake is a fertile, hard water basin of 197 acres.  The lake is managed for primarily northern pike.  The only stocking in recent years was after a partial winter kill in 1991-92 and consisted of fingerling largemouth bass and northern pike.       To evaluate lake management goals, a lake survey was conducted which included night electrofishing on May 19th, trap and gill netting from June 21st to June 24th, and shoreline seining on August 12th.     Anglers on Horseshoe Lake should encounter an assortment of fishing opportunities.  Good numbers of bluegill were present in variety of sizes.  Though few bluegill were over 7 inches, more than half exceeded 6 inches.  Northern pike numbers rebounded since the 2000 survey.  While not as abundant as in the 1995 nettting, they fell well within the normal range given the lake type and averaged 2.6 pounds.  Largemouth bass abundance and quality continues to increase.  Bass averaged 12.7 inches.  Black crappie numbers and size may not be acceptable to some anglers.  All sampled black crappie were less than 8 inches.      Shoreline seining indicated reproduction of bluegill, green sunfish, and largemouth bass.       Other species sampled during the survey include;  bowfin (dogfish), common carp, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, hybrid sunfish, green sunfish, pumpkinseed, white crappie, painted turtle, and snapping turtle.     Horseshoe Lake receives moderate fishing pressure.  Anglers typically target bluegill, bass, and northern pike.</p>'

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/08/2009 Clarity: 5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Little is a 159 acre lake located in southeast Chisago County near Center City.  High fertility affects water clarity through periodic algal blooms.  The number of lake residences is fairly low considering the lakes location.  Boats can be launched via a public access on the north shore of the lake.  Parking is available for approximately 8 to 10 rigs.  Managed primarily for walleye and northern pike, the lake is stocked with 125 pounds of walleye fingerlings biennially.  Fishing pressure is high especially given the lakes small size.  The access was frequently filled to capacity during the summer field work. <br> 
 <br> 
Based on 2009 field results, the high angling pressure is warranted.  Black crappies were more numerous in the gill nets than they have been in the past.  Crappies averaged just over eight inches in both the trap nets and gill nets.  Relatively few captured crappies exceeded 8.5 inches; conversely, few preceded 7.5 inches.  Largemouth bass size and abundance remains good, though lower than in 2004.  Thirty six percent of the bass captured were over 13 inches in length.  Like bass, bluegill abundance decreased.  However, bluegill size quality was high with a 7.2 inch average and few individuals less than 7 inches, a size acceptable to many anglers.  Northern pike abundance, though lower than past assessments remained typical of Little and other lakes with a similar nature.  Northerns were quality sized averaging 26.3 inches and 4.4 pounds.  Like bluegill, yellow perch numbers were down some but with a subsequent increase in size structure.  Forty two percent of the perch catch exceeded 8 inches in length, a harvestable size for many anglers.  Walleye remained scarce based on the gill net catch.  Five of the six walleye captured in the netting were larger than 20 inches.  Other species sampled included; yellow bullhead, bowfin (dogfish) and pumpkinseed sunfish. <br>

 Lake Clarity = '' 
 Narrative = '<p>Little Comfort Lake is a small fertile lake located in southwestern Chisago County just east of the City of Wyoming.  Water depths of 15 feet or less make up 44% of the lakes 36 acres.  In the winter of 1985/86 Little Comfort Lake experienced a partial fish winterkill, but has not showed evidence of a winterkill since then.  The fishery is replenished during this type of event via its connection to Big Comfort Lake.  This connection also provides supplemental fish to the fish community.  During the winter, when ice and heavy snow cover can cause a decrease in light penetration, lakes with an abundance of shallow water acreage may experience low oxygen levels.  Becaues plants, which require light for survival, are the primary producers of oxygen during the winter season and bacteria consume oxygen when decomposing dead plants, fertile shallow lakes may be subject to some degree of fish winterkill when oxygen levels decline.  Little Comfort Lake may be subject to winterkill during severe winters.  The lakes surrounding shoreline is characterized by marshland, residential land, and bog land while the watershed is primarily lake/marshland followed by urban/residential land, marshland, undeveloped forest or woodland, livestock/pasture, and crop land.  Little Comforts fishery is managed primarily for northern pike with largemouth bass, bluegill sunfish, and black crappie as the secondary management species.  Past management has included an alternating full survey and population assessment schedule as per a five year rotation.  However, a scheduled population assessment was not conducted in 1995 due to time constraints.  Since Little Comfort lacks a public access and has a self sustaining fishery, future management goals could be modified to a full survey as per a ten year schedule.A standard lake survey was conducted during the week of June 22, 2000 to evaluate the current status of the fish population, the physical, chemical, and biological factors concerning habitat, and the water quality.  Evaluation of the fish population utilized gill net, trap nets, and late summer shoreline seining.  The selected gear types were chosen based on guidelines obtained from the MN DNR Manual for Instructions to Lake Survey.  Habitat and water quality data were also collected based on guidelines from this manual.  Numbers of northern pike for this lake type were found to be below normal; however, the average weight, at 3.9 pounds, was above normal.  Fish lengths extended from 20.9 to 29.3.  Little Comfort Lake northern pike growth was typical of normal when compared to statewide averages.  Currently, walleye stocking has not been included in management practices due to the lakes small size and lack of public access.  Previous surveys have never sampled walleye in test nets before the 2000 survey.  Current walleye abundance was well above normal for this lake type while an average weight of 2.1 pounds was typical of normal.  Walleye lengths extended from 14.2 to 26.2 inches with a very respectable average length of 18.1 inches.  The resident walleye population in Little Comfort Lake has most likely resulted due to migration from Big Comfort Lake which has been stocked on a regular basis.  Lack of suitable walleye spawning habitat, lack of historical walleye stocking, and the presence of year classes that match stocking efforts in Big Comfort Lake supports the above conclusion regarding the origin of Little Comfort walleye.  One 12.8 inch largemouth bass that weighed just over a pound was sampled during the 2000 survey.  Since gill and trap nets have not been as effective at capturing largemouth as spring night electrofishing, future management goals should include this sampling gear as part of the next survey.  Two of the panfish species sampled during this survey, black crappie and pumpkinseed sunfish, were found at normal abundance levels while bluegill sunfish were well above normal in number.  According to historical records, the bluegill catch in 2000 was the highest ever recorded while the average size was the smallest ever recorded.  Panfish lengths ranged from 5.8 to 8.1, 3.7 to 4.9, and 3.5 to 7.5 inches, respectively.  When compared to statwide averages, bluegill and crappie growth was representative of normal.  Yellow perch were found in below normal numbers.  Previous surveys indicated that perch numbers were always low in abundance.  Reproductive success for bluegill sunfish and largemouth bass was good white some success was displayed for black crappie.  Other fish species captured during the 2000 survey included black and brown bullhead, bowfin (dog fish), common carp, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, and white sucker.</p>'

 Survey Date = '2010-08-23',  County Name = 'Chisago', Lake Name = 'North Center Lake' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/23/2010 Clarity: 2.3' 
 Narrative = '<p>North Center Lake is a 725 acre, fertile lake, managed primarily for largemouth bass and walleye.  The lake is stocked annually with walleye fingerlings.  The shoreline is predominately sand while the water clarity can be low due to algae blooms.  The lake, popular with anglers and boaters, receives high user pressure.  The public access, though large, can be filled to capacity at times.  Two hundred seventy lake homes make for a highly developed shoreline.  During the summer of 2005, the culvert connecting North and South Center lakes was replaced with a more navigation friendly bridge.  At normal water levels, this will provide easier travel between the lakes.  In keeping with the current lake management plan, a lake assessment was conducted to evaluate long range goals.  The assessment consisted of night electrofishing on May 19th and gill and trap netting the week of August 23rd. <br> 
 <br> 
The lake supports a quality sized walleye population at abundance levels typical of the lake type.  Walleye sampled during the survey averaged 19.3 inches and 3.1 pounds with lengths ranging from 7.4 to 26.8 inches.  <br> 
      <br> 
Northern pike were slightly less abundant than walleye but also of quality size.  Netted pike averaged 31.9 inches and 6.4 pounds.  In 2003, a special northern pike regulation was implemented following a public input meeting.  Northerns between 24 and 36 inches are now protected from harvest.  The regulation goal is to encourage the continued harvest of smaller northerns while increasing the lake's potential to produce trophy sized fish. <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth bass were abundant with an 11 inch and 0.8 pound average.  Sampled bass ranged from 5.3 to 19.2 inches.  Bass quality has slipped a little since the previous assessment.  Just under one fourth of the catch in the recent assessment exceeded 12 inches in length compared to half the sample in 2005. <br> 
 <br> 
Both bluegill and black crappie numbers were high compared to similar lakes.  Size acceptance may be an issue with some anglers.  Crappie averaged 7.3 inches but relatively few passed the 8 inch mark.  While most bluegill surpassed 6 inches, very few attained 7 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Anglers on North Center Lake can expect heavy fishing pressure and a crowded public access at times.  The majority of the pressure is directed toward bass and panfish.  Bass, bluegill, and crappie are abundant.  Northern pike and walleye, though less common, present a bonus fishery of large individuals.</p>'

The lake's south shore is connected to South Lindstrom Lake by a narrow channel that is navigable by small boat (<14') at normal water levels.  North Center Lake is connected to the northeast end of the lake.  The shore is predominately sand and the water clarity is relatively good compared to other area lakes.  Development is lighter than nearby lakes.  Fishing pressure has likely decreased in recent years.  An access previously used by the public has been closed by the landowner, leaving only a city street end access which has no parking.  The current lake management plan lists northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie as the primary management species. <br> 
 <br> 
During the summer of 2010, a population assessment was conducted to evaluate the current status of the fishery in North Lindstrom Lake.  Sampling gear types consisted of spring night electrofishing to sample largemouth bass and standard gill and trap nets to sample the remaining fish species.  Northern pike numbers were at a historic high but within the normal range for the lake type, while the average weight, at 3.7 pounds, was above the normal range.  Two thirds of the captured northern pike surpassed 24 inches in length.  Spring night electrofishing found a high abundance of largemouth bass with a somewhat small average size of 0.6 pounds.  Lengths extended from 6.3 to 17.1 inches.  The number of bluegill sunfish and black crappie sampled were within the normal range in all gear types.  Both species have shown improvement in size since the last evaluation.  Over one fourth of the bluegill exceeded 7 inches while more than half the crappie catch topped the 8 inch mark.  Walleye have not been stocked in North Lindstrom Lake since 1978.  The 2010 gill net catch rate for walleye was within the normal range and their average size was 2.8 pounds.   Measured walleye ranged from 16.6 to 26.2 inches with an average length of 19.5 inches.  Yellow perch, an important forage species for northern pike and walleye, were at a very low level   Previous surveys indicate that perch numbers have historically been low and may easily be affected by the abundance of northern pike or walleye.  The fish community was also made up of black, yellow, and brown bullhead, pumpkinseed, hybrid and green sunfish, bowfin (dogfish), golden shiner, and white sucker. <br> 
 <br> 
An angler fishing North Lindstrom Lake is likely to encounter a good number of nice sized northern pike or an occasional larger walleye.  An abundance of smaller largemouth are available with some quality sized bass also present.  A good number of bluegill sunfish with bonus black crappie will keep panfish anglers busy.  In the past, shore fishing has accounted for a lot of the open water fishing pressure on North Lindstrom Lake.  Individuals who do not have access to a boat may want to consider this lake for bank fishing.  Bank anglers primarily target panfish and northern pike.  Because North Lindstrom Lake lies within a watershed that has a lot of urban/residential development, agricultural crop land, and livestock/pasture land the lake is subject to some degree of nutrient input.  Such nutrient input can influence a lake's water clarity.  Land users within the watershed can help maintain or improve the current water quality by protecting or re-establishing buffer strips, updating outdated or failing septic systems, using phosphorus free fertilizer on surrounding lawns, gardens, or crop land, utilizing farming practices that reduce run-off, limiting aquatic plant removal or disturbance, and limiting construction of impervious surfaces near the shoreline.</p>'

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/28/2014 Clarity: 4.4' 
 Narrative = '<p>South Lindstrom Lake is a moderately hard water and moderately fertile 499 acre lake located in southern Chisago County bordering Chisago City. The lake is broadly connected to Chisago Lake by a natural channel. The two lakes are somewhat physically different with South Lindstrom having a smaller percentage of littoral (less than 15 feet depth) acreage (42%) than Chisago (80%). The channel allows fish to migrate freely between the two lakes. Because past surveys and assessments dating back to 1956 indicate similar fish composition and abundance, the two lakes are considered one for management purposes. Currently, the primary management species are Walleye and Largemouth Bass. <br> 
 <br> 
The Chisago chain of lakes, which also includes Chisago, North Lindstrom, North Center, and South Center, has a history of extreme water level fluctuations. These fluctuations, up to 7 vertical feet, are believed to be due to a net loss of water to groundwater in the system, making the lakes dependent on long term cycles in precipitation.  The water levels in 2009 were the lowest they have been in 40 years.     <br> 
 <br> 
Chisago-South Lindstrom Lake was selected for a special Largemouth Bass regulation due to a 1995 survey that found a high abundance of small bass in both basins. A 12-inch maximum size limit for Largemouth Bass was implemented in March 1997 and was based on the premise that angler harvest was limiting the size structure of the Largemouth Bass population. Post regulation surveys have indicated that the overall population size structure of Largemouth Bass has improved. Nighttime spring electrofishing was conducted on May 27, 2014 to assess the current Largemouth Bass population. A catch rate of 244 fish per hour was the highest catch rate observed in South Lindstrom Lake. The modal length group of Largemouth Bass observed in the electrofishing assessment was 13 inches, and lengths ranged from 7.3 to 17.8 inches. Currently, the Largemouth Bass population is meeting the objectives of the special regulation.   <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye catch rates were above average at 7.0 fish per net, which is similar to levels observed in the 2000 and 2005 assessments. Mean weight of Walleye was similar to the past two surveys at almost 2.4 pounds. Walleye lengths ranged from 12.8 to 25.6 inches with a mean length of 18.5 inches. Otolith data sorted the thirty aged Walleye into seven year classes, with all but one fish corresponding to years with fall fingerling stockings. The 2009 year class (stocked) accounted for 53% of the catch. The Walleye catch rate of 7 per net is within the long range goal of 3 to 8 per net. <br> 
 <br> 
The Northern Pike gill net catch of 4.8 per net was above average when compared to similar lakes in Minnesota. Northern Pike catch rates have been similar in all surveys since 1995, when catch rates peaked at just over 6 fish per net. Previous to the 1995 assessment, catch rates were less than 2 per net. Mean weight was similar to the last assessment at 3.1 pounds and remained above average. Northern Pike lengths ranged from 12.8 to 30.2 inches with a mean length of 23.9 inches. The oldest Northern Pike sampled was age-8 and 7 year-classes were represented.   <br> 
 <br> 
Trap nets sampled Bluegill at above average rates. The mean weight, 0.22 pounds, was also above average.  Bluegill lengths ranged from 3.3 to 8.1 inches with a 6.4 inch mean length.  Bluegill 7 inches and greater represented 44% of the catch, a good ratio for the Chisago Lakes Area. However, not many Bluegill exceeded 8 inches.   <br> 
 <br> 
Black Crappie gill net catch rates declined to 8.0 per net and the trap net catch rates also declined to below average. Mean weight, based on the trap net catch declined to well below average, while the mean weight of Black Crappie caught in the gill nets also declined but remained above average. Sampled Black Crappie lengths ranged from 5.3 to 10.5 inches and had a mean length of 7.0 inches, however only a few fish over 8 inches were observed. <br> 
   <br> 
Yellow Perch numbers continue to decline and catch rates are at the lowest levels ever observed.  Now at 1.3 per gill net, they are well below average when compared to similar lakes. White Sucker catch rates are also at the lowest point ever observed and no Golden Shiners were caught during the assessment.   <br> 
 <br> 
Quality fishing opportunities exist for most species in South Lindstrom Lake. At times fishing pressure can be high and anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help maintain and improve the quality of South Lindstrom Lake's fishery. Selective harvest encourages releasing larger fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish.  Releasing medium to large fish will help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future. The current Largemouth Bass regulation is a great example of this. This regulation protects larger fish, which has created excellent catch-and-release angling opportunities for Largemouth Bass larger than 12 inches, while still allowing for harvest of the smaller fish. <br> 
 <br> 
Non-native invasive species of vegetation are present in South Lindstrom Lake.  Eurasian Watermilfoil was first documented in South Lindstrom Lake in the fall of 2009 and Curlyleaf Pondweed has been present since at least 1969. Anglers and boaters should take necessary precautions to prevent the further spread of invasive species. <br> 
 <br> 
Some shorelines of South Lindstrom Lake are highly developed, which can put stress on the lake's aquatic habitat and ecosystem integrity.  Environmentally friendly development practices, such as shoreline buffer strips of natural vegetation, are encouraged to help maintain and improve the water quality of South Lindstrom Lake. Water level fluctuations in the Chisago chain of lakes can leave exposed sediments and if left alone, these areas will naturally vegetate and stabilize the shorelines on their own. Also, if trees and branches have fallen in the water, consider leaving them where they are to provide important habitat for fish and wildlife that is often missing in highly developed lakes. <br>

A private access with a fee is available on the east side of the lake.   <br> 
 <br> 
Ample angling opportunities are available on the lake.  Northern pike and largemouth bass abundance has decreased since the 2003 assessment, but with a subsequent increase in size.  Bass quality is high averaging 13.8 inches and 1.5 pounds.  The northern size is also impressive.  The twenty seven northern pike sampled averaged  27.8 inches with one individual exceeding 40 inches.  Black crappie and bluegill remain very abundant.  Crappie size has improved in recent years.  The current assessment found 40% of the fish 8 inches or longer.  Bluegill would be considered small by most anglers with a 6 inch average and relatively few fish over 7 inches.   <br>

 Survey Date = '2016-08-15',  County Name = 'Chisago', Lake Name = 'West Rush' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/15/2016 Clarity: 2.9' 
 Narrative = '<p>West Rush Lake is a 1,464 acre lake assigned to lake class 25. West Rush's fertility results in low water clarity with a Secchi depth reading of 2.9 feet. The primary management species in the lake are Walleye, Northern Pike, and Muskellunge. The Walleye and Muskellunge populations are currently maintained through annual stockings. The previous survey was conducted in 2012. Muskellunge are assessed in a separate survey during the spring. <br> 
 <br> 
The Northern Pike catch rate was 0.4 fish per gillnet. Pike catch rates have historically been low in West Rush, but this rate was significantly lower than the historic mean. With only five fish in the total sample, it is difficult to draw any definite conclusions. All pike sampled were larger fish averaging 30.3 inches long. They also appear to exhibit good growth. There is a slot limit in place on the Rush Lakes protecting Northern Pike between 26 and 40 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye catch rates were also low at 0.5 fish per net, similar to the previous two surveys and well below the normal range for similar lakes. Prior to the 2007 survey, catch rates were consistently much closer to lake class norms. Similar to pike, it is difficult to develop any conclusions from analysis of a six fish sample. Walleye ranged in size from 9.8 to 25.8 inches in length, averaging 15.8 inches. Age analysis suggests that Walleye growth is relatively unremarkable. Anecdotal reports from anglers have indicated some success fishing for Walleye, which is not reflected by our netting.  <br> 
 <br> 
A catch rate of 74.8 fish per gill net for Yellow Perch was high, well above the normal range for similar lakes. Catch rates have historically exceeded the normal range and this year's catch was at the upper end of the historic range. West Rush's Yellow Perch also have a better size structure than many similar lakes, averaging 0.2 lbs. Perch ranged from 4.8 to 10.7 inches in length and averaged 7.3. Numbers of fish drop dramatically after 8.5 inches, a size where the fish tend to become susceptible to angler harvest.  <br> 
 <br> 
The trap net catch rate for Black Crappies of 5.6 fish per net was the highest it has been in the last couple of decades, following an increasing trend and well above the normal range for similar lakes. The gill net catch was also very high at 11.8 fish per net, but not as high as the previous several surveys. Trap nets sampled a range of sizes from 4.7 to 10.2 inches long and averaged 7.9. Twenty-two percent of crappies were longer than 9 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Trap net catch of Bluegill was the highest in history with 24.9 fish per net. Bluegill catch has varied widely in historical sampling and this year's catch rate is within the normal range for similar lakes. Bluegills were well-distributed between 2.8 and 8.3 inches in length and averaged 6.2. Similar to the other panfish species in the lake, numbers of Bluegill dropped after reaching a size where they become desirable to anglers. <br> 
 <br> 
Electrofishing sampled 11.3 Largemouth Bass per hour which was the lowest rate since electrofishing efforts began in 1997. Bass ranged from 6.6 to 16.2 inches in length and averaged 11.3. This low catch rate is not reflected in anecdotal reports from anglers. This is an observation that took place on other nearby lakes as well. A number of variables could be negatively affecting electrofishing catch rates such as aquatic vegetation density and variability in seasonal changes.    <br> 
 <br> 
While Muskellunge are assessed during in independent spring survey, one 46.1 inch fish was sampled during summer trap netting. Other species sampled included Freshwater Drum, Golden Shiner, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Common Carp, Pumpkinseed, and Green Sunfish. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2015-07-27',  County Name = 'Clay', Lake Name = 'Lee' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/27/2015 Clarity: 7.6' 
 Narrative = '<p>Lee Lake is a 134-acre, class 34 lake located in eastern Clay County.  Although relatively deep for a small lake (maximum depth of 36 feet), it is a fertile lake that is sharply stratified during summer months.  A large campground on the northeast shore now has approximately 80, semi-permanent, camper trailers that have greatly increased recreational use on Lee Lake.  In addition to the campground, a new Public access has improved the accessibility of the lake for recreational use.  The access is located on the Northwest side of the lake off of Minnesota Highway 32 and 7th Ave south.   During the winter of 2015, concerns were brought to the DNR's attention as the water had turned red.  After some water sampling it was determined that a filamentous blue-green algae was present in the sample.  A few species of this group are planktonic, and at certain times of the year turn the water a blood red color.  After doing a dissolved oxygen test it was determined that the algae was not affecting the amount of oxygen in the water.   Lee Lake was very unusual compared to other western Minnesota lakes in that it had no bullheads sampled until the 2015 survey. <br> 
 <br> 
In 2015, the Northern Pike catch rate was 9.7 per gill net, up from 2.7 in 2005 and also above the lake's historical average of 7.2 per net.  The mean length of Northern Pike sampled in 2015 was 23.7 inches and lengths ranged from 14.7 to 34.7 inches.  Northern Pike up to eight years old were found.  Lee Lake's Northern Pike exhibited faster than normal growth, with four-year-old Northern Pike reaching 26 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill abundance as indicated by trap net catches have fluctuated widely in Lee Lake.  The 2015 Bluegill catch rate of only 9.2 fish per trap net indicates a continued fluctuation in the Bluegill population.  This catch rate is far below what was observed in 2005 (31.3 per trap net) and also below the lake's historical average (23.9 per trap net).  Bluegill had a mean length of 7.0 inches and ranged in size from 3.5 to 8.7 inches.  Bluegill growth was faster than that of the previous survey with Bluegills reaching almost seven inches by four years of age.   <br> 
 <br> 
Gill net catch rates of Walleye have remained above the lake's historic mean of 2.1 per net since 1990.  During this survey, 2.5 Walleyes per gill net were captured.  Walleye had a mean length of 16.2 inches and ranged in size from 9.3 to 27.4 inches.  Walleye up to 14 years old were found, with four year old fish reaching an average length of just over 16 inches.  Now that a functioning public access exists on Lee Lake, fingerling stocking was resumed in 2013.  Future surveys will be used to evaluate the success of this stocking. <br> 
 <br> 
Although Largemouth Bass were stocked in the 1930s, 1980, and 1988, the first bass was not sampled in Lee Lake until 1995 when two were captured.  The 2015 survey sampled 51 Largemouth Bass with various methods.  Average size was 10-12 inches long, depending on the method, with fish up to 17.1 inches being captured.  Largemouth Bass reached 12.3 inches long by the time they were four years old.   <br> 
 <br> 
Black Crappie catches had declined since 1985.  The Black Crappie catch rate in trap nets of 12.4 found during this survey was the highest recorded for Lee Lake and much above the lake's historical average of 5.2 per trap net.   Black Crappie mean length was 5.3 inches and ranged from 3.9 to 10.3 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
The Yellow Perch gill net catch rate in 2015 was 35.7 per set, which was slightly more than the lake's historical average catch rate.  The mean length of sampled Yellow Perch was 6.5 inches, but some fish up to 9.5 inches were captured. <br> 
 <br> 
Brown Bullhead had historically not been present in Lee Lake, but anglers reported catching them in 2014.  In 2015, their presence was confirmed with Brown Bullheads being observed while electrofishing and also captured with both trap nets and gill nets.  Fifty four Brown Bullheads were sampled, ranging in size from 7.9 to 14.4 inches long.  It is unknown how they got into Lee Lake, but it is likely it occurred during a high water event when one of the streams connected Lee Lake to wetlands upstream. <br> 
  <br> 
Lee Lake is a very small lake that is experiencing increasing levels of recreational activity.  It is one of the first lakes encountered by Fargo/Moorhead metropolitan residents traveling east towards Detroit Lakes.  Observations by fisheries field crews suggest a decline in water quality from earlier surveys.  However an improving trend has been seen in the last two surveys.   Fish survey water quality data is only a snapshot collected in late July, but it is difficult to ignore declining water clarity readings, progressively more water that does not contain sufficient oxygen during summer stratification, and increasing phosphorus concentrations.  Practicing selective fish harvest, following the correct steps to prevent the spread of invasive species, and protecting water quality by using shoreland and watershed best management practices are highly encouraged. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2016-08-22',  County Name = 'Clay', Lake Name = 'Tilde' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/22/2016 Clarity: 2' 
 Narrative = '<p>Tilde Lake is a 259-acre, class 43 lake in northeastern Clay County, approximately five miles northeast of Hitterdal.  The maximum depth is 13 feet and the lake experiences occasional winterkill.  The lake's shoreline is undeveloped except for a single farmstead near the southeast shore.  The surrounding watershed is primarily agricultural (small grain croplands) although there is a fringe of hardwoods and wild grasslands around much of the lake.  While the vegetative fringe probably helps to buffer the lake from field runoff, there are at least three intermittently flowing ditches draining surrounding farmland into the lake.  Based on a total phosphorus concentration of 179 ppb in 2005, Tilde Lake could be considered hyper-eutrophic.  However, two other indicators of trophic state (water clarity and chlorophyll-a) were more indicative of late mesotrophy or early eutrophy.  Algal blooms are common during summer and Walleyes in this lake are reported by some to have an undesirable flavor when the water warms. <br> 
 <br> 
Tilde Lake experienced a significant winterkill during the winter of 2012-2013.  The highest dissolved oxygen reading found on April 3rd of that year was 0.3 ppm.  No test netting was done to confirm the extent of the winterkill, but a near total kill was assumed due to the low amount of oxygen and prolonged ice cover.  Walleye fry were stocked the following spring with the intentions of not only restoring the Walleye fishery, but also provide a unique opportunity to harvest Walleye fingerlings to transferring to other local fishing lakes.  This strategy proved successful as 858 pounds, or 25,740 fish, of Walleye fingerlings were harvested from Tilde Lake in the fall of 2013.  Walleye fry were again stocked in 2014, but this time the stocking did not result in an abundance of young fish that could be utilized for harvest.  Walleye fry stocking resumed to the normal every other year stocking rotation in 2016.  Despite the lakes history of winterkill and questionable water quality, Tilde Lake does appear to contain some good walleye-spawning habitat as the most abundant year class found in the 2005 population assessment was attributed to a non-stocking year (2003).   <br> 
 <br> 
The scheduled standard survey of Tilde Lake was abbreviated due extreme catches of young of year Walleye.  Only two gill nets and six trap nets were fished during the survey in 2016.  The gill net catch rate for Walleye was an astonishing 199.5 fish per net.  The historical average Walleye gill net catch rate prior to this survey was 19.6 fish per net.  As mentioned, the vast majority of sampled Walleyes were from the spring fry stocking just a few months prior.  These young of year fish grew fast despite their abundance, averaging 7.6 inches in length.  The dominance of these fish also skew any further value in size-based indices for the Walleye population as a whole.   The remaining sampled Walleye originated from the previous two fry stocking events following the winterkill in 2013.  These two- and three-year-old Walleyes were 14 to 18 inches long.   <br> 
 <br> 
Other species sampled in low numbers included Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Rock Bass and Yellow Perch.  In most of these instances it appeared only a single year class of adults were captured of each specie.  This would suggest a private stocking event had occurred following the winterkill. <br> 
 <br> 
Black Bullhead were historically common and a recent presence of Common Carp had become established in Tilde Lake.  However, since none of these species were sampled in Tilde Lake in 2016 it can be assumed the winterkill experienced in 2013 was sever enough to even eliminate these tolerant species. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2014-07-07',  County Name = 'Clearwater', Lake Name = 'Pickerel' 
 Lake Clarity = '' 
 Narrative = '<p>Pickerel Lake is a 123-acre lake with a maximum depth of 60 feet located in southern Clearwater County.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical characteristics, water chemistry and fish community.  Pickerel Lake is in Lake Class 28 along with Bungo, Deep, First, and Lomond lakes in Clearwater County.  Lakes in this class are typically small, deep, infertile lakes with clear water and round basins.  During the 1990s and early 2000s the water level of Pickerel Lake rose approximately 10 feet, which flooded shoreline timber and inundated the public water access, which was located on the southeast shore of the lake at the end of Pine Island Lake Road north of State Highway 113.  Currently, the access is difficult for larger boats with little room to turn around or park and is more suited to smaller or non-motorized watercraft.  Most of the shoreline of the lake is undeveloped, with a small number of lakeside homes and cabins.  Pickerel Lake is managed for Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Northern Pike.  Due to the low fertility of the lake, growth rates of most fish species are slow, which can limit the maximum size they are able to achieve.     <br> 
 <br> 
Black Crappie catch rates in both gill nets and trap nets (6.83/gill net and 3.38/trap net) were above average when compared to other lakes of similar size and type, indicating that Pickerel's crappie population is fairly abundant.  The average size of Black Crappie captured in trap nets (9.7 inches in length and 0.49 lbs/fish) was similar to that of other Class 28 lakes.  Black Crappie up to 11.77 inches in length were captured in the 2014 assessment.  The extensive flooded timber and aquatic vegetation found within the lake provides excellent habitat for all species present including Black Crappie.   <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth Bass are abundant in the lake as well, with a gill net catch rate (2.5/gill net) above the normal range for Lake Class 28 lakes.  The average size of Largemouth Bass captured (11.94 inches in length and 1.04 lbs/fish) was also similar to other Class 28 lakes.  Bass up to 15.39 inches in length were captured in the assessment.  Largemouth Bass utilize Bluegill as their primary forage species in Pickerel Lake.   <br> 
 <br> 
While Pickerel Lake has been known for an overabundant Bluegill population dominated by small fish, the 2014 assessment showed some improvement in the population since the previous assessment in 2004. The Bluegill catch rate of 21.13/trap net declined considerably from 2004 (35.56/trap net) and was within the normal range for lake class (14.25/gill net to 40.45/gill net).  Average size was also similar at 0.17 lbs/fish.  The largest Bluegill captured was 8.35 inches in length.  A majority of the Bluegill catch was between 5.5 inches and 7.0 inches in length.  Twenty percent of the Bluegill captured were greater than 7 inches in length.  Slow growth rates are a limiting factor in the production of quality-size Bluegill in Pickerel Lake. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike were captured at a rate of 6/gill net, which is just above the median value of 5/gill net for Lake Class 28 lakes.  Unlike many area lakes, Pickerel still holds a Pike population that is not dominated by lots of small "hammer handle" fish, although there has been a considerable decrease in average size of Northern Pike since the 2004 assessment.  In 2004, the average size of Pike captured was a very respectable 27.47 inches in length and 5.09 lbs/fish.  Average size declined to 21.9 inches in length and 2.7 lbs/fish in 2014.  The largest Northern Pike captured in the 2014 assessment was 35.63 inches in length.  Twenty five percent of Northern Pike captured in the assessment were greater than 24 inches in length. Unlike bass and panfish, Northern Pike grow quickly in Pickerel Lake, with growth rates above those measured in similar lakes, resulting in the potential to produce larger fish.   <br> 
 <br> 
Other species of fish captured in the 2014 assessment of Pickerel Lake were Yellow Perch, Rock Bass, Hybrid Sunfish, White Sucker, and Brown Bullhead.      <br>

 Survey Date = '2012-08-07',  County Name = 'Cook', Lake Name = 'Beth' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/07/2012 Clarity: 14' 
 Narrative = '<p>Beth Lake is 170 acres with a maximum depth of 22 feet and is located 21 miles north of Schroeder completely within the BWCAW. The lake is accessed by one of three portage routes. Alton Lake, to the east, is a 144 rod portage, or about half of a mile. Ella Lake, to the north, is a 72 rod portage, about 0.2 miles. Grace Lake, to the west, is a 285 rod portage, or about 0.9 miles. The half mile portage from Alton Lake crosses the Laurentian divide and is a particularly arduous portage. Four remote campsites are present with latrines and cooking grates. <br> 
 <br> 
The 2012 resurvey showed Beth to be a very soft water lake with low fertility. Water quality analysis revealed a secchi disc reading of 14 feet in clear water. Temperature and oxygen remained nearly constant throughout the water column. Substrates were dominated by boulder and interspersed with rubble, gravel and ledge rock. Spawning habitat was rated poor for northern pike, yellow perch and white sucker and good for smallmouth bass. Twenty-one different aquatic plant species or species groups were identified. Vegetation was very sparse and was observed growing to a depth of only 2.5 feet. The majority of submerged or floating leaf vegetation consisted of quillwort, pipewort, water lobelia, floating burreed and water lily. One small inlet with intermittent flow is present on the northwest portion of the lake originating from Ella Lake. The small channel was dry and braided across large boulders at the mouth. One outlet is present on the west end of the lake flowing into Grace Lake.  <br> 
 <br> 
Beth Lake offers the angler small but plentiful small smallmouth bass.  Smallmouth bass gill net catch rates were well above average for the lake class at 13.7/lift. Average size was small at 0.48 pounds/fish. The average length of fish sampled was 9.7 inches with the largest fish only 12.76 inches. Growth of smallmouth bass is slower than average by Finland Area standards.  Smallmouth bass are maintained in the lake by natural reproduction with 10 different year classes present during the last sample.  However, the majority of the catch (85%) came from three different year classes. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike gill net catch rate was well below average both in numbers and size, 0.5/lift and 0.8 pounds/fish. Average length was 15.7 inches with the largest fish only 17.9 inches. All three fish that were sampled were two years old and growth was average by Finland Area standards. <br> 
 <br> 
White sucker and yellow perch were also sampled but in very low numbers.  All anglers on Beth Lake must abide by BWCAW regulations at all times; the lake is entirely non-motorized.  <br>

 Narrative = '<p>Anglers who like to target Brook Trout for their beauty, fight, and taste while spending time amidst some of Minnesota's wildest, most scenic settings may want to try Feather Lake, a designated stream trout lake 12 miles north of Schroeder in the Superior National Forest.  Public access is a 90 yard carry from the parking area across upland and bog.  From USFS #170 (Four Mile Grade) go 0.8 mile northeast of the Toohey Lake access, then 0.7 mile east on the Feather Lake access road to the parking area.  This remote lake is lightly fished.  Open water angling is most suitable for anglers with a canoe or float tube.  Shoreline angling is limited as most of the shoreline is lined by bog.  As Feather Lake is a designated trout lake it is important to check the current Minnesota Fishing Regulations to follow all rules applicable to designated trout lakes. <br> 
 <br> 
The lake is 8.7 acres, 90% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth with a maximum depth of 24 feet.  Like many lakes in the Finland Area, Feather Lake contains very soft water of low fertility.  Muck and detritus are common around most of the lake, with some rubble, gravel and sand along the south shore.  No submersed vegetation was observed in Feather Lake.  Emergent vegetation species include watershield and yellow waterlily.  The lake has no inlets or outlets. <br> 
 <br> 
The 2014 Brook Trout gill net catch in one set was 16, higher than average for stocked Brook Trout lakes in the area.  The mean weight of 0.64 pounds and length of 11 inches was also higher than average for the Finland Area.  The largest fish sampled was 13.2 inches and weighed 1.25 pounds.  Seven of the sampled fish were 12 inches larger, all of which were two years old.  Brook Trout growth was slightly faster than average for the Finland Area. <br> 
 <br> 
Feather Lake despite its small size produces some nice trout and occasionally a 16 inch plus fish is caught.  The lake is considered one of the better fingerling stocked Brook Trout lakes in the Finland Area.  It is reasonably accessible and the Brook Trout have no competition with other undesirable species. <br>

 Survey Date = '2010-06-21',  County Name = 'Cottonwood', Lake Name = 'Bingham' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/24/2010 Clarity: 1.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Bingham Lake is a 274-acre lake located near the City of Bingham Lake in Cottonwood County. Bingham Lake has a maximum depth of 10.0 feet, a shoreline length of 3.2 miles, and is a class 43 lake.  The Cottonwood County Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD) applied for a Clean Water Partnership grant with the Pollution Control Agency in 2010 but was unsuccessful.  We will continue to encourage and work with the SWCD to apply for the grant again in 2011.  The lake is managed primarily for walleye while largemouth bass, yellow perch, channel catfish, black crappie, and northern pike are managed secondarily.  Bingham has been treated annually for several years with copper sulphate to control algae blooms.  There was a die-off of algae resulting in low oxygen levels due to the decomposition of the algae during the summer of 2008 causing a fairly significant summerkill on the lake.  Oxygen levels were below 2 parts per million (ppm) and numerous dead walleye, channel catfish, and fathead minnows were observed. <br> 
 <br> 
The walleye population has recovered from the summerkill in 2008.  Walleye numbers are higher than they have ever been on Bingham Lake since we have been doing population assessments on the lake.  The walleye gill net catch rate was 32.0 compared to 3.7 in 2006 and 1.3 in 2002.  No walleye were sampled when we did a special survey in 2008 to assess the extent of the summerkill.  The walleye sampled in 2010 had total lengths ranging from 12.3 to 18.2 inches, with an average length of 15.9 inches.  The majority of fish were in the 15 to 18 inch range.  The fishery will likely provide some good fishing for walleye in the next few years. <br> 
 <br> 
The yellow perch population is also doing very well in Bingham Lake.  The gill net catch rate of 20.5 fish per net was down slightly from the survey in 2006, but considered very good for lakes similar to Bingham Lake.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in our gill nets in 2010 ranged from 9.1 to 12.2 inches and averaged 10.9 inches.  Many of the yellow perch were in the 11 to 12 inch range.  These sizes of fish are highly desirable for anglers. <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie numbers are up some when compared to the other fish surveys done on Bingham Lake and are about what we would expect for lakes similar to Bingham.  Lengths of black crappie caught in gill nets ranged from 4.6 to 10.8 inches and had an average length of 8.4 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Black bullhead have provided excellent fishing opportunities in the past on Bingham Lake and based on our fish survey results, should provide excellent opportunities in the future.  Good numbers of large black bullhead were caught in our nets in 2010.  Lengths of black bullhead caught in trap nets ranged from 6.1 to 15.4 inches and averaged 11.3 inches.  The majority of black bullhead caught were in the 11 to 13 inch range.  The summerkill in 2008 had little effect on the black bullhead population. <br> 
 <br> 
Other fish sampled during the fish survey included bigmouth buffalo, channel catfish, common carp, pumpkinseed, fathead minnow, orangespotted sunfish, and johnny darter.  <br> 
 <br> 
To maintain a healthy fishery in Bingham Lake; we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP's) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br>

 Survey Date = '2015-06-08',  County Name = 'Cottonwood', Lake Name = 'Double' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/08/2015 Clarity: 3.2' 
 Narrative = '<p>Double is a 246 acre lake located west of Storden in Cottonwood County.  The lake consists of two separate basins connected by a six foot diameter culvert.  This culvert is the only public boat access available to enter the South basin.  There is a MNDNR owned public access on the North basin and the Red Rock Sportsman's Club maintains a handicapped accessible fishing pier on the South basin.  Despite both basins having winter aeration systems, occasional partial winterkills still occur, but haven't affected the diverse fish community.  Sixteen fish species were sampled in a population assessment conducted during the week of June 8, 2015 using 2 gill nets and 5 trap nets in the north basin.  This complex system is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for crappie, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike. <br> 
 <br> 
The Walleye gill net catch rate of 20.0 per set was the second highest on record in eight surveys dating back to 1986.  Historical gill net catches have ranged from 2 to 22 per net with a long term average of about 10 per net.  There were four year classes present and they were dominated by two year old fish from the 2013 fry stocking.  Total lengths of Walleye sampled ranged from 9 to 22 inches with an average length of 13.7 inches.  Walleye have always been popular in Double Lake and should continue to provide excellent angling in the future. <br> 
 <br> 
Double has a reputation for excellent crappie angling over the years.  This may change for a few years since our assessment captured record low numbers of Black Crappie at 0.8 per trap net.  There were 4.0 to 5.2 inch crappie captured in gill nets, and 9.0 to 9.6 inch fish captured in trap nets.  Hopefully these two year classes can reestablish the crappie population without additional stocking. <br> 
 <br> 
The Yellow Perch gill net catch rate of 25.0 per set is the highest catch on record for 8 surveys since 1986.  Total lengths of perch in gill nets ranged from 5.9 inches to 10.4 inches with an average length of 8.3 inches.  These perch should provide quality angling for "keeper" size fish for the next couple years. <br>

Only one 18.2 inch Northern Pike was captured in gill or trap nets during this assessment although the south basin was not sampled.  The most recent stocking of 50 adult northern in 2012 does not appear to have improved the abundance of pike.  Additional stocking of pike may be necessary to meet management goals for a "predator" to control Freshwater Drum populations. <br> 
 <br> 
Freshwater Drum, also known as sheepshead, were first observed in the 1999 population assessment.  There is speculation that drum entered Double through the Cottonwood River and Highwater Creek  after the Flandreau dam was removed in 1995.  The catch rate of 6.0 per gill net was down slightly from the 2011 survey catch rate of 4.5 per set.  These fish ranged from 11 to 17 inches in total length, and provide another angling opportunity.  There is some negative stigma about eating Freshwater Drum but their fillets consists of white flakey meat that can be hard to differentiate between other game fish fillets. <br> 
 <br> 
The Black Bullhead catch rate of 10.2 per trap net, and the Common Carp catch rate of 2.2 per trap net are well below the long term average for this lake type.  The relatively low abundance of these two species may be contributing to higher water transparency readings in recent years. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill sunfish first appeared in the 2015 survey, and although their numbers are still low at 1.6 per trap net they may continue to flourish with the improved water clarity.  The majority of Bluegill sampled were of preferred size to anglers at 7.5 to 10 inches long. <br> 
 <br> 
Other species sampled in relatively low numbers during this assessment included White Sucker, Bigmouth Buffalo, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, White Crappie, Yellow Bullhead, Channel Catfish, and Shorthead Redhorse. <br> 
 <br> 
To maintain a healthy fishery in Double Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMPs) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br>

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/13/2014 Clarity: .7' 
 Narrative = '<p>INTRODUCTION <br> 
Eagle Lake is a 120-acre lake located near the City of Mountain Lake in Cottonwood County. Eagle Lake averages 6.0 ft. deep and has a maximum depth of 8.0 ft. Eagle Lake suffered a severe winterkill during the winter of 2013-2014. A winterkill assessment done in April only captured black bullheads at a rate of 121.8 per trap net. The winter of 2013-2014 proved to be harsh on many area lakes, as the ice was snow covered for much of the winter and ice thickness was consistently over 30 inches, preventing sunlight penetration for photosynthesis. Eagle Lake is managed primarily for yellow perch and secondarily for walleye and northern pike. Because sport fish populations were decimated from winterkill, adult yellow perch, adult walleye, northern pike fingerlings, and walleye fingerlings were stocked in 2014. A population assessment was conducted during the week of August 13, 2014 using one gill net and eight trap nets to gauge the success of the stockings.  <br> 
 <br> 
YELLOW PERCH <br> 
Historically, yellow perch have been extremely abundant in Eagle Lake with catch rates of 256.0 per gill net in 1995 and 127.0 per gill net in 2008. Following the winterkill and subsequent restocking in 2014, yellow perch were captured at a rate of 26.0 per gill net, which is below the long term average of 136.3 per gill net, but slightly above the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes. This indicates that there were plenty of adult yellow perch in the lake to reproduce and bolster the population. Lengths of yellow perch ranged from 5.4 to 9.9 inches and averaged 8.1 inches. Yellow perch were plump, indicating that prey is abundant in Eagle Lake. The yellow perch population appears to be recovering from the winterkill in 2013-2014, and should have a decent population of yellow perch in a couple of years.  <br> 
 <br> 
NORTHERN PIKE <br> 
Management of northern pike in Eagle Lake began in 2004, which marks the first stocking of northern pike fingerlings in this system, in recent history. Additionally, northern pike fingerlings were stocked in 2007, 2010, 2011, and 2014. Despite stocking efforts, northern pike had not been sampled in Eagle Lake until the 2014 survey, when they were captured at a rate of 3.0 per gill net and 0.9 per trap net. The gill net catch rate of 3.0 is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes. Northern pike sampled in gill nets and trap nets ranged from 8.7 to 11.4 inches and averaged around 10 inches, and are likely the northern pike fingerlings that were stocked in mid-June 2014. The northern pike population should be on its way to recovery barring any setbacks during the winter of 2014-2015.  <br> 
 <br> 
WALLEYE <br> 
Walleye have been abundant in the two surveys that have been conducted since walleye management began in Eagle Lake in 1999 (initial fry stocking). In 2008, walleye were captured at a rate of 27.0 per gill net. In 2014, the catch rate of walleyes was slightly higher at 29.0 per gill net, which is higher than expected catch rates for similar lakes. The walleyes that were captured in the gill net were likely from the stocking of adult walleyes that occurred in May 2014. Walleyes ranged in length from 12.4 to 19.5 inches and averaged 14.9 inches. Walleye were plump, indicating that there is plenty of food available in Eagle Lake. Walleyes will continue to be stocked every third year to maintain the walleye population. The next walleye fry stocking will occur in 2015.  <br> 
 <br> 
BLACK BULLHEAD <br> 
Black bullhead abundance has been highly variable since 1995, as gill net catch rates went from 26.0 per gill net in 1995 to 251.0 per gill net in 2008 to 99.0 per gill net in 2014, and as trap net catch rates went from 109.4 per trap net in 1995 to 5.0 per trap net in 2008 to 133.5 per trap net in 2014. The 2014 gill net catch rate was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes. The 2014 trap net catch rate slightly exceeded what would be expected in similar lakes. Black bullhead captured in the trap nets ranged from 4.7 to 11.9 inches and averaged 6.6 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
OTHER SPECIES <br> 
Bluegill (7.8 per trap net) and black crappie (1.5 per trap net) were sampled in the 2008 survey, but were not sampled in the 2014 survey. These species are vulnerable to low dissolved oxygen levels and likely did not survive through the winter of 2013-2014. Additionally, yellow bullheads were sampled in 2008 (0.8 per trap net), but were not detected in 2014.  <br> 
 <br> 
Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> 
 <br> 
Best management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake. High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality. Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2014-08-25',  County Name = 'Cottonwood', Lake Name = 'Mountain' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/25/2014 Clarity: 3.8' 
 Narrative = '<p>INTRODUCTION <br> 
Mountain Lake is a 241-acre lake located within the City of Mountain Lake in Cottonwood County. The lake has a maximum depth of 7.0 feet, and has a watershed to lake ratio of 22 to 1. In the early 1990's, Mountain Lake had a diverse fish population. During the winter of 1993-94, the lake suffered a partial winterkill resulting in an increase in Common Carp and Black Bullhead abundance, which resulted in a decrease in aquatic vegetation. Because of the high abundance of undesirable fish, Mountain Lake was reclaimed during the fall of 1998, with the goal to restore desirable fish populations, re-establish aquatic vegetation, and improve water quality. Aquatic vegetation is abundant in Mountain Lake, to the extent that a vegetation harvester is operated by the City of Mountain Lake on an annual basis. Mountain Lake is managed primarily for Largemouth Bass and Bluegill, and secondarily for Yellow Perch, Walleye, Northern Pike, and Black Crappie. Walleye are the only species of fish that have been stocked in the last decade (2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014). A population assessment was conducted the week of August 25, 2014 to monitor fish populations using one gill net and nine trap nets.  <br> 
 <br> 
LARGEMOUTH BASS  <br> 
Since the reclamation in 1998, Largemouth Bass abundance has varied from 33.3 per hour in 2004 to 228.0 per hour in 2000. In 2014, the catch rate of Largemouth Bass was 121.0 per hour which is the second highest catch rate recorded on Mountain Lake and an increase from 36.8 per hour observed in 2010. Lengths of Largemouth Bass ranged from 5.5 to 20.2 inches and averaged 8.9 inches. The majority (85 percent) of the bass sampled were 5.5 to 8.5 inches and are likely from the 2013 year class (age-1). Largemouth Bass were plump, indicating that forage is readily available in Mountain Lake. It appears that the Largemouth Bass population in Mountain Lake a stable, naturally reproducing population.  <br> 
 <br> 
BLUEGILL <br> 
The 2014 Bluegill catch rate of 11.7 per trap net is the lowest catch rate observed post-reclamation, but is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.0 per trap net). Since the 1998 reclamation, catch rates have varied from 11.7 per trap net in 2014 to 172.2 per trap net in 2002. Bluegill ranged in length from 3.6 to 8.8 inches and averaged 6.3 inches. Bluegill were plump, indicating that prey is readily available in Mountain Lake. The Bluegill population is self-sustaining, as stocking has not occurred since the initial stocking after the reclamation in 1999. Bluegill successfully reproduced in 2014, with over 1,550 age-0 Bluegill being captured in a near shore survey conducted in early August. The Bluegill population should continue to be stable as long as recruitment remains consistent.  <br> 
 <br> 
YELLOW PERCH <br> 
Catch rates of Yellow Perch post reclamation have varied from 13.5 per gill net in 2002 to 71.0 per gill net in 2010. The 2014 catch rate was 36.0 per gill net, which exceeds the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net). Generally speaking, catch rates of Yellow Perch were higher in years preceding the reclamation (averaged 70.9 per gill net in 1985, 1990, 1994, and 1997) than in the year after the reclamation (averaged 37.7 per gill net in 2002, 2004, 2010, and 2014). This is likely a result of cleaner water and increased aquatic vegetation that followed the reclamation, which favors different species of fish such as Largemouth Bass and Bluegill. Yellow Perch ranged in length from 5.6 to 10.9 inches and averaged 9.3 inches. Yellow Perch have not been stocked following the reclamation suggesting that the population is able to sustain itself with natural reproduction.  <br> 
 <br> 
WALLEYE <br> 
The 2014 Walleye catch rate was the highest observed catch rate for Walleye since surveys began in 1985 on Mountain Lake. Walleyes were captured at a rate of 21.0 per gill net, which is higher than the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net). Previous catch rates of Walleye ranged from 0.0 per gill net in 1994 to 11.5 per gill net in 2002. Ages estimated from otoliths (inner ear bones used to age fish) indicated that the majority of the Walleyes were age-2, which corresponds to the 2012 stocking event. Gill-netted Walleye ranged in length from 13.8 to 17.8 inches and averaged 14.8 inches. Trap-netted Walleye ranged in length from 11.9 to 24.7 inches and averaged 17.3 inches. The average length at age estimate for age-2 Walleye from Mountain Lake was 14.4 inches, which is average growth when compared to mean length at age estimates from similar lakes (mean length at age for age-2 Walleye was 14.3 inches for similar lakes). Average growth and high condition (plumpness) indicate that prey resources for Walleye are abundant in Mountain Lake. The current regime of stocking fingerlings every other year appears to be successful and will continue until further evaluation during the next survey in 2018.  <br> 
 <br> 
NORTHERN PIKE <br> 
Since the reclamation in 1998, the Northern Pike population has been stable, as catch rates have ranged from 1.0 per gill net in 2014 to 3.0 per gill net in 2004. The 2014 catch rate of 1.0 per gill net is below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.1 to 8.0 per gill net), and is the lowest catch rate observed post-reclamation. Two Northern Pike were captured during the survey and were 23.9 and 32.6 inches in length. Consideration will be given to stocking Northern Pike fingerlings at a rate of 10 per littoral acre to boost the population.  <br> 
 <br> 
BLACK CRAPPIE <br> 
The 2014 catch rate of Black Crappie was 0.7 per trap net, similar to the 2010 catch rate of 0.9 per trap net, but below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net). Black Crappies ranged in length from 3.2 to 3.8 inches and averaged 3.5 inches. It appears that natural reproduction of Black Crappie did not occur in 2014 because no age-0 Black Crappie were captured in a near shore survey conducted in early August; however, the presence of 3.5 inch Black Crappie in the survey indicates that natural reproduction occasionally occurs.  <br> 
 <br> 
OTHER SPECIES <br> 
Common Carp were sampled in Mountain Lake for the first time since the reclamation in 1998. Common Carp abundance in trap nets was 3.4 per trap net and gill nets was 9.0 per gill net, both within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.0 to 5.5 per trap net; 1.0 to 13.8 per gill net). It appears that one year class of Common Carp accounts for the majority of the population with lengths of trap netted carp ranging from 16.0 to 20.6 inches and gill netted carp ranging from 15.3 to 19.5 inches. One 7.9 inch Common Carp was sampled as well.  <br> 
 <br> 
Black Bullhead abundance has been highly variable since the reclamation, ranging from 47.0 per gill net in 2010 to 233.0 per gill net in 2002. In 2014, the Black Bullhead catch rate was similar to the 2010 catch rate (47.0 per gill net), at 53.0 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (30.3 to 150.6 per gill net). Black Bullheads ranged in length from 5.0 to 12.8 inches and averaged 10.2 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow bullhead were captured at a rate of 29.0 per gill net, which greatly exceeds the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.5 to 3.5 per gill net). Yellow bullhead ranged in length from 5.5 to 13.5 inches and averaged 10.3 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
Other species sampled included Pumpkinseed and Hybrid Sunfish.  <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2000-06-05',  County Name = 'Cottonwood', Lake Name = 'Summit' 
 Lake Clarity = '' 
 Narrative = '<p>Summit Lake is an 80 acre lake with a maximum depth of 10 feet and is located near the city of Windom in Cottonwood County.  The lake is presently managed for largemouth bass as the primary species while bluegill and walleye are managed secondarily.  The lake was reclaimed in 1992 and restocked with largemouth bass, bluegill, and walleye in 1993.  Unauthorized stocking resulted in additional fish species present in 1996 and 2000.  The lake is susceptible to algae blooms and winterkill since the addition of black bullhead in Summit.  Because of low oxygen levels in the lake during the winter of 2000-01, the following status of the fishery may likely have changed drastically.     The largemouth bass electrofishing catch rate was 12.7 in 2000 compared to 30.0 in 1996.  Lengths ranged from 12.2 to 16.0 inches and averaged 19.6 inches.  Year classes from 1995 through 2000 were not collected during the assessment indicating minimal natural reproduction.     The bluegill trapnet catch rate of 26.4 was high for lakes similar to Summit.  The bluegill trapnet catch rate was 16.6 in 1996.  Lengths of bluegill ranged from 3.9 to 8.7 inches and averaged  5.8 inches.  The bluegill population was dominated by age 2 fish (84% of the fish collected).     The black crappie trapnet catch rate of 74.3 was high for lakes similar to Summit .  The black crappie trapnet catch rate was 2.3 in 1996.  Lengths ranged from 4.9 to 10.9 inches and averaged  6.4 inches.  Year classes from 1995 through 1998 were collected during the survey.  The population was dominated by age 2 fish (77% of the fish collected).     The black bullhead trapnet catch rate of 190.1 was high for lakes similar to Summit.  The black bullhead CPUE was 25.2 in 196.  Lengths of black bullhead ranged from 4.6 to 11.8 and averaged 9.5 inches.      Two northern pike and zero walleye were collected during the assessment.     To promote and maintain a healthy fish population, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitat is directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the chemical and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Summit Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.            </p>'

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/01/2010 Clarity: 17' 
 Narrative = '<p>Adney Lake is a 304 acre lake located 4 miles southeast of Crosslake, in Crow Wing County.  A public access is located on the east side of the lake.  The maximum depth is 27 feet and 52% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  The lake has relatively soft water, moderate fertility, and good clarity.  The number of cabins/homes around the lake increased slightly from the previous count in 1998 to a relatively high density of 26 cabins/homes per shoreline mile in 2010.  Shallow water substrates are primarily sand, with some gravel, rubble, and muck also present.  The lake supports a diverse aquatic plant community consisting of 30 species.  Aquatic plants help prevent erosion, stabilize bottom sediments, provide spawning habitat, and provide food and shelter for a variety of aquatic organisms.  <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike were captured at a rate of 21.2 per gill net in 2010.  This is, the highest catch of the previous four surveys on the lake dating back to 1967 and is high when compared to similar lakes.  Pike growth was good and fish averaged 20.9".  <br> 
 <br> 
Spring electrofishing was used to sample largemouth bass in Adney Lake for the first time in 2010.  The catch of 191 fish per hour was very high for the area.  Several year classes were identified and although growth was slow, fish averaged 11.7" and measured up to 20".   <br> 
 <br> 
The catch of black crappie was typical for this type of lake and remained similar to previous surveys.  The bluegill catch was also normal for this type of lake, but was a decrease from pervious catches on Adney.  Size was decent for both species. <br> 
 <br> 
Additional sampling for nearshore fish was also conducted using shoreline seining and backpack electrofishing.  Several species of darters, shiners, and other minnows were collected.  In addition, a single young of the year smallmouth bass was collected.  This was the first record of smallmouth in this lake, and indicates at least a small population capable of reproducing.  A total of 17 species of fish were collected in all sampling methods combined during the 2010 survey.     <br>

Northern pike, the lakes primary game fish species, were sampled at a rate of 6.0 per gill net.  This was higher than the three previous fish surveys performed on the lake.  Aging identified several year classes and found growth of pike to be good.  Fish between 14.0 to 32.9 inches were captured and average size was 22.7" and 3.1 pounds.   <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth bass, another important game fish species for this lake, were captured at a rate of 1.0 per gill net and 0.4 per trap net.  These values are within the expected range for this type of lake, and are similar to catches from previous surveys.  Growth of bass was average. <br> 
 <br> 
Popular panfish species sampled during the survey include bluegill and black crappie.  The bluegill catch of 25.0 per trap net was average compared to similar lakes and previous surveys, but growth was slow with only 7% measuring over seven inches long.  Black crappie were captured in high numbers in gill nets and low numbers in trap nets.  Fish averaged 8.5" and growth was average. <br> 
 <br> 
Additional sampling for nearshore fish was also conducted using shoreline seining and backpack electrofishing.  Least Darter, a species of special concern in Minnesota, was collected along with a variety of other darter, shiner, and minnow species.  Combining all methods, the 2010 survey identified 22 fish species in the lake. <br>

Submergent species grew to a depth of about 20 feet in 1994.  These species provide cover and feeding areas for a wide variety of fish species.Northern pike and largemouth bass were the most abundant gamefish species in the 1994 netting.  Compared to similar type lakes, northern pike abundance was "high."  However, average length was 24 inches and average weight was 3.1 lbs..  Seven age classes were sampled in fairly uniform numbers and growth was good.  Largemouth bass were also caught in "high" numbers.  Average weight was 1.6 lbs. and six age classes were present.The bluegill catch was "average" compared to similar type lakes.  Seven age classes were sampled and growth was slow.

There is state land adjoining the lake but no developed public access.The fish population appeared typical for this kind of lake.  Black bullheads, which are tolerant of low winter oxygen conditions, made up about one-half of the fish catch in trapnets (used to indicate abundance of bullheads, bass, crappies and sunfishes).  Of the sport fish species, bluegills and crappies were present in average numbers.  Crappie growth was slow and bluegill growth was also slow until about age five.  Spawning conditions appeared to be good for these species.  Northern pike were sampled in low numbers but individuals seemed to have good growth.  Spawning conditions appeared to be limited.

 Narrative = '<p>Clark Lake is a 343 acre lake located in west-central Crow Wing County with a maximum depth of 31'.   Due to the fertility of the lake, periodic partial winterkills have been known to occur in the past.  The primary management species is northern pike, with bluegill and black crappies being the secondary management species.  A population assessment was conducted the week of June 2, 2014. <br> 
 <br> 
The northern pike catch rate for this assessment was 10.5/gill net, which is close to the average for Clark.  The average size of these fish was 22.1" with fish up to 30.1" measured.  Nearly 32% were 24" or larger.  In order to maintain or improve the northern pike population, anglers are encouraged to keep some smaller northern pike and release larger ones, particularly those over 24". <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill catch rate was 40.8/trap net, which is above average for lakes like Clark.  The average size bluegill was 6.6" and the largest sampled was 8.8".  Nearly 29% of these fish were 7" or larger. <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappies are another option for anglers.  The catch rate was 2.6/trap net, which is close to average.  The average length of black crappies was 8.4" and fish up to 10.2" were sampled.  More than 69% were 8" or larger. <br> 
 <br> 
Although not sampled well with gill nets and trap nets, largemouth bass are also available for anglers.  Only 4 were sampled in the assessment, all in trap nets.  This yielded a catch rate of 0.4/trap net, which is slightly below average for lakes that are similar to Clark.  The average size of these 4 fish was only 8.8" with the largest at 10.4".   <br> 
 <br> 
Walleyes have been stocked over the years with many of the stockings taking place after a partial winterkill.  Walleyes were last stocked in Clark in 1998, when 264,000 fry were put in and then via private lake association stocking of fingerlings in 2011.  The catch rate has never been higher than 1.0/gill net.  Only 2 were sampled in gill nets in 2014 for a catch rate of 0.3/gill net.  When aged, both fish appear to have originated from the 1998 stocking.  There is also some potential for fish movement from Lake Hubert or Nisswa Lake via connection to Clark Lake.   <br>

 Narrative = '<p>Island Lake is a 240 acre, moderately fertile, soft water lake located 3 miles southeast of Emily, in Crow Wing County.  A public access is located on the east side of the lake.  The maximum depth is 37 feet and 63% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  The number of cabins/homes around the lake remained relatively unchanged from the previous count in 1999 with 19 cabins/homes per shoreline mile.  Shallow water substrates are primarily sand, with gravel and muck also common.  The lake supports a very diverse aquatic plant community consisting of 38 species.  Aquatic plants help prevent erosion, stabilize bottom sediments, provide spawning habitat, and provide food and shelter for a variety of aquatic organisms.  <br> 
 <br> 
An assessment of the fish population was completed in 2010 and compared to the seven previous surveys dating back to 1966.  Northern pike were captured at a rate of 2.0 per gill net.  This catch, while low compared to similar lakes throughout the state, was typical of past netting results.  Growth was average, and 33% of pike sampled were at least 24".   <br> 
 <br> 
Despite a long history of stocking, the catch rate for walleye (0.7 per gill net) was again below average for this type of lake, which is consistent with previous survey results. Walleye growth was slow, with age two fish averaging just 7.8".   <br> 
 <br> 
Spring electrofishing was used to sample largemouth bass in Island Lake for the first time in 2010.  The catch of 35 fish per hour was low for the area, but several year classes were identified.  Growth was average, with fish averaging 11.2".   <br> 
 <br> 
The catch of black crappie remained similar to the last survey.  Fish between 4.8 to 11.2 inches were sampled.  Growth was slow and only 19% were greater than 8".  The bluegill catch of 7.9 per trap net was similar to previous catches.  Several year classes were observed, but growth was slow and only 14% were greater than 7". <br>

Assessment work consisted of standard lake survey netting using gill nets and trap nets.   The last assessment netting on Lake Byllesby was completed in 2008.  Previous years assessments were usually completed in mid-July.

High turbidity levels from runoff and excessive algal blooms limit submersed vegetation and likely impact the fishery.  The reservoir is affected by excessive sediment loading in the upper reaches and much of the upper lake consists of shallow sand and mud flats at normal flow and lake levels.  The fish community is similar to many reservoirs with a diverse fish population that includes many riverine species.  Lake Byllesby can provide a fair fishery, especially in winter when many fish houses are present.  Anglers typically target Black Crappie and Walleye.

 Narrative = '<p>Lake Andrew is a 918-acre, moderately fertile basin located just south of Alexandria.  It is a relatively deep lake.  Mean and maximum depths are 29.0 and 83.0 feet, respectively.  Water clarity is good.  Average water transparency measurements typically exceed 9.0 feet during summer months.  This lake is a popular destination for both anglers and recreational boaters.  Residential development around the lake is considered moderate.  Most of the watershed remains in agricultural production, but municipal and light industrial developments have encroached into the watershed.  A concrete public access is located along the south shoreline off South Lake Andrew Drive.  

Lake Andrew is now designated as an infested waterbody due to presence of zebra mussels.  Adult zebra mussels were first confirmed in 2016.  Regulations restricting bait harvest and transport of water apply to this basin.  For more information regarding aquatic invasive species in Minnesota see the following: http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/aquatic/index.html 

Lake Andrew holds a diverse and abundant aquatic plant community.  Of particular interest are large expanses of hardstem bulrush and common cattail bordering the north and west shoreline.  These areas provide critical habitat for many fish species and must be protected to maintain integrity of the fish community.     

Lake Andrew supports a diverse fish community and offers a wide range of fishing opportunities.  Primary management efforts are directed at sustaining a Walleye fishery.  Walleye fry are stocked on an alternate year basis to supplement natural reproduction and bolster walleye abundance.  Stocking efforts have been highly successful and Walleye are currently abundant.  Gill net catches averaged 12.6 fish/net in 2016, exceeding catch rates considered normal for this type of lake.  High abundance is attributed to an extremely strong 2012 year class, which accounted for approximately 77% of the Walleyes captured in gill nets.  Age and growth analyses indicated the majority of Walleyes from this year class have grown to a harvestable size.  This cohort ranged in length from 12.4 to 18.1 inches with an average length of 14.9 inches.  Fall electrofishing efforts indicated another extremely strong year class was produced in 2016.  Walleye abundance will likely remain high in future years if this year class recruits into the sport fishery.  

Other gamefishes contributing to the fishery include Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfishes such as Bluegills, Black Crappies, and Yellow Perch.   Northern Pike are extremely abundant.  A record- high survey catch occurred in 2016.  This population is largely comprised of young or small individuals.  Mean pike length was just 18.7 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Too many small pike is a common problem in many lakes in west-central Minnesota.  Harvest of small pike is highly encouraged to help keep this population in check.  Largemouth Bass catches during electrofishing surveys have decreased in recent years.  Current abundance is considered moderate.  Much of the population is comprised of younger, smaller fish.  Only 12% of the 2016 sample exceeded 15.0 inches in length.  Bluegill numbers have increased in recent years and current catch rates describe population density as moderate, in terms of both abundance and size structure.  Harvestable-size Black Crappie and Yellow Perch are also present but abundance of these species is relatively low.     

Other species recorded in the 2016 lake survey included Bowfin (Dogfish), Common Carp, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Tullibee (Cisco), White Sucker, and Black, Brown and Yellow Bullhead.  The next lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2020.  

Fishing pressure on Lake Andrew can be heavy at times, during both open water and winter seasons.  To help maintain the high-quality attributes of Lake Andrew's fishery, anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages release of larger fish and directed harvest on more abundant smaller fish.  Releasing medium to large fish will help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch larger fish.

 Lake Clarity = '' 
 Narrative = '<p>Cook Lake, also known as Cork Lake, is a small lake located west of Alexandria adjacent to Lobster Lake.  The lake has no public access but winter anglers access the lake off HWY 114.  The lake is fringed with dense stands of cattail and water lilies.  Submergent vegetation is also extremely abundant.  The large amounts of vegetation provide very good spawning and nursery habitat.  These plants also enhance water quality by protecting the shoreline from wave action and taking up available nutrients preventing algal blooms.  The mid-summer secchi reading was 12.0 feet.Cook lake is utilized primarily in winter due to the lack of a public access.  Winter anglers target bluegill and black crappie.  Bluegill relative abundance increased from 5.2 fish per trapnet in 1996 to 13.0 fish per trapnet in 2001.  Approximately 83% of the sampled fish exceeded 6.0 inches with 10% exceeding 8.0 inches in length.  Black crappie numbers have also increased slightly with a trapnet catch of 1.5 fish per net.  These fish averaged just over 9.0 inches long.Northern pike can also be active on the lake and catch rates have increased from 6.5 fish per trapnet in 1996 to 9.5 fish per trapnet in 2001.  The mean length of the sampled fish was 19.9 inches with the largest fish measuring 22.7 inches.  The mean weight these fish was 1.6 pounds.Largemouth bass are extremely abundant with a electrofishing catch rate of 142.5 fish per hour.  The size structure, however, is less than desirable with a mean length of 9.6 inches and no fish measuring over 14 inches.  </p>'

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/12/2016 Clarity: 14.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Lake Darling is a 945-acre basin located on the northwest edge of the city of Alexandria and is part of the Alexandria Chain of Lakes.  There is no public access on Lake Darling; however, boaters can gain access via a navigable channel from Lake Carlos.  The lake is popular for both angling and other water-based recreation.  The 450-acre Arrowwood Resort and Conference Center is located along the west shore. Most of the shoreline is heavily developed with residential housing.  Water quality and clarity are good. Mid-summer water transparency was recorded at 14.5 feet.  The lake supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  Aquatic plants help maintain water quality and clarity by competing with algae for available nutrients in the lake.  Aquatic plants also provide spawning habitat and cover for many fish species, especially bass and panfishes.  Turtle Bay on the west end of the lake is posted as a no-wake zone to protect aquatic vegetation.  <br> 
 <br> 
Lake Darling sustains a modest Walleye fishery.  Some natural recruitment or immigration from connected basins is supplemented with combined fingerling and yearling stockings by the DNR, Lake Darling Association, and Viking Sportsmen Club, Inc.  Gill net catches declined in 2016 to 3.1 Walleye/net.  A majority of Walleyes caught during the survey were young, two- or three-year-old fish.  Average size of Walleye measured during the survey was 14.8 inches.  Few 20.0-inch and larger captures were recorded during the survey. <br> 
   <br> 
Lake Darling supports abundant populations of Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Bluegills.  Due to moderate fertility of the lake and high abundance of these fishes, growth rates are slow.  Fortunately, gamefishes in Lake Darling live to be quite old, thus it does support some larger fish.  An 8.0-inch Bluegill may be 10 years old.  Largemouth Bass also grow slow but have been shown to live up to 19 years old in the Alexandria Chain of Lakes.  Few Black Crappies are captured during summer surveys since larger fish move off-shore and are less vulnerable to capture in trap nets.  Low catch rates recorded in surveys does not accurately reflect abundance and size distribution.  Lake Darling does support good crappie fishing, particularly during spring months.  Adult Yellow Perch numbers have consistently been low. Yellow Perch are preferred prey of Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass. <br> 
 <br> 
Quality fishing opportunities exist for many species in Lake Darling.  Even modest harvest of slow-growing, older fish can degrade fishing quality.  Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help maintain and improve the quality of the Lake Darling fishery. Selective harvest encourages release of larger fish while promoting harvest of more abundant smaller fish.  Releasing medium to large fish will help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> 
 <br> 
Lake Darling was designated as an infested water after discovery of zebra mussels in 2009.  Minnesota statutes require all equipment be free of invasive species prior to leaving any access.  Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent further spread of invasive species. <br>

 Narrative = '<p>Lake Geneva is a 631-acre lake located on the eastern edge of the city of Alexandria and is part of the Alexandria Chain of Lakes.  A navigable connection exists to Lake Le Homme Dieu.  A connection also exists to Lake Victoria, but shallow water can make navigation difficult or impossible for some boats.  There are two public accesses on Lake Geneva.  The access on the east shoreline is steep and more difficult to use.  The access on the northwest shoreline is more user friendly.  There is also a handicap-accessible public fishing pier located near the public access on the northwest shore.  The fishing pier is located in a shallow bay that is a popular fishing spot for anglers throughout the open water season, particularly in the spring.  Boaters should be cautious of navigation hazards on the lake.  Several shallow bars extend into the lake.  Much of the shoreline on Lake Geneva has been developed.  A trend of increasing water clarity continues.  Water transparency was 21.0 feet at time of the 2016 survey.  <br> 
  <br> 
Lake Geneva supports a modest Walleye fishery.  The fishery is maintained by some limited natural recruitment, fish movements among lakes, and supplemental stockings of Walleyes.  Gill net catch rates declined in 2016 to 3.4 Walleyes/net.  Average length of Walleye captures was 16.1 inches.  Age distribution of catches extended to age 8.  The largest Walleye captured measured 23.5 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Lake Geneva supports abundant populations of Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Bluegill.  Due to moderate fertility of the lake and high abundance of these fishes, growth rates are slow.  Fortunately, gamefishes in Lake Geneva live to be quite old, thus it does support some larger fish.  Bluegills over 8 inches were caught during the survey.  Largemouth Bass also grow slow but have been shown to live up to 19 years old in the Alexandria Chain of Lakes.  The largest bass caught during the survey was 18.3 inches.  Few Black Crappies are caught during summer surveys since larger fish move off-shore and are less vulnerable to capture in trap nets.  Low catch rates recorded in surveys does not accurately reflect abundance and size distribution.  Lake Geneva does support good crappie fishing.  Yellow Perch catches and average size of perch captured during surveys have declined over the last few surveys. Yellow Perch are preferred prey of Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass.  <br> 
 <br> 
Quality fishing opportunities exist for many species in Lake Geneva.  Even modest harvest of older fish can degrade fishing quality.  Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help maintain and improve the quality of the Lake Geneva fishery.

 Survey Date = '2016-07-11',  County Name = 'Douglas', Lake Name = 'Gilbert' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/11/2016 Clarity: 6.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Gilbert Lake is a small (202 acres), shallow basin located approximately nine miles west of Alexandria.  A small public access with limited parking is located on the northwest shoreline.  Water quality and clarity have been poor due to nutrient enrichment and frequent and occasionally severe algae blooms.  The shallow and fertile nature of this basin make the fish community vulnerable to periodic winterkill.  The last significant winterkill event occurred during the 2013-2014 winter.  Fish community composition, gamefish diversity, and fishing potential have been constrained by poor habitat conditions, severity of winterkills, and gamefish species restocked following winterkill events.  Walleye fry and pre-spawn adult Black Crappie, Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Yellow Perch were stocked after the winterkill of 2013-2014. <br> 
 <br> 
A standard MN DNR lake survey was completed in July 2016 to assess fish community structure and determine success of post-winterkill stockings.  Survey methodology also included spring electrofishing to estimate abundance and size distribution of the Largemouth Bass population.  This sampling event occurred on May 24.  <br> 
  <br> 
The recent winterkill and prompt re-establishment of predator populations resulted in much improved habitat conditions.  Water transparency was 6.5 feet at time of the mid-July survey.  In probable response to increased water clarity and sunlight penetration, submerged vegetation was found throughout the basin. <br> 
 <br> 
Re-introductory stockings of adult Largemouth bass and Black Crappies were successful and recruitment of young fish was exceptional.  Both Black Crappies and Largemouth Bass proved to be abundant; however, fishing potential remained marginal since most captures were two-year-old fish, the offspring of limited numbers of adults stocked following the winterkill event.  Black Crappie captures averaged approximately 7.4 inches.  Average length of bass captured during the electrofishing survey was 9.3 inches.  Bluegill reproduction was documented, but catches were well below that of other gamefishes.  Most of those captures were also two-year-old fish.  A Walleye fry stocking in 2014 was also successful in re-establishing a Walleye population.   Twenty-five two-year-old Walleyes were captured in gill net sets.  Those young walleyes were growing fast, averaging 12.9 inches at capture.  Restorative stockings in 2014 also included 455 juvenile Yellow Perch.  A promising fishery may develop as this population matures.   Yellow Perch catches were comprised of three age classes, age-1 through age-3, which indicated that a reproducing population was established.  Gill net catches were high at 54.3 fish/net.  Perch are also growing rapidly in a post-winterkill environment.  The older, age-3 captures averaged 10.3 inches.  This population is likely to attract the attention of anglers once cohorts of the strong 2014 year class recruit into the fishery. <br> 
   <br> 
Sustained development of this promising fishery will continue to hinge on frequency and severity of winterkill events.  Occasional winterkills and prompt re-introduction of predators may be beneficial in limited expansion of Black Bullhead and Common Carp populations.  Survey catches of both fishes was greatly reduced in 2016. <br> 
 <br> 
The next standard survey is tentatively planned for summer 2026.  Targeted assessments may occur upon suspicion or documentation of winterkill events to assess severity of such fish mortality events.         <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2014-08-18',  County Name = 'Douglas', Lake Name = 'Grants' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/18/2014 Clarity: 15' 
 Narrative = '<p>Grants Lake is a 171-acre lake located nine miles southwest of Alexandria. This small, dimictic basin has a maximum depth of 60.0 feet and an estimated average depth of 25.0 feet.  Fisheries productivity is limited by basin morphology and fertility.  Only 36% of the lake area is less than 15.0 feet in depth.  The lake was thermally stratified during the August survey.  A thermocline was detected below 15.0 feet.  Dissolved oxygen concentrations below 21.0 feet were too low to sustain fish life.  Water quality is considered good with an average summer Secchi transparency measurement in excess of 10.0 feet.  Despite good water transparency, Grants Lake does not support a robust aquatic plant community.  Most submergent plants occur along the north end of the lake near Holmes City and along Douglas County Highway 4. <br> 
 <br> 
Much of the shoreline around Grants Lake is steeply sloped.  Residential development is moderate, with most homes located on the west side of the lake.  A public access is located on the northwest side of the lake.  Fishing pressure on Grants Lake is relatively light. <br> 
  <br> 
Grants Lake supports a diverse gamefish community that can provide good angling opportunities and quiet, quality fishing experiences.  A new addition to the fish community was noted during the 2014 survey, Smallmouth Bass.  This species was not captured during preceding surveys and was not introduced by the Department of Natural Resources.  A total of 55 fish were captured during the 2014 fish community assessment.  Size of captures ranged from 5.5 to 16.9 inches suggesting smallmouth bass are reproducing.  Due to the limited productivity and carrying capacity of this lake, addition and expansion of an additional predator species may result in undesired ecological impacts to other gamefish populations. <br> 
   <br> 
A fair Walleye fishery is sustained through fry stockings.  Fry are stocked on a three-year frequency.  Gillnet catches averaged 6.8 fish/gillnet. This catch rate exceeded expectations for Grants and similar lakes.  Size of captures ranged from 9.3 to 21.7 inches in length and averaged 13.1 inches.  Most of the walleye catch was comprised of yearling fish stemming from the 2013 fry stocking.  At sustained growth rates, these fish should exceed 14.0 inches in length in late-summer of 2015. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike relative abundance estimates have steadily decreased from a high of 9.0 fish/gillnet in 1999 to a low of 3.2 fish/gillnet in 2014.  Most of the pike sampled were less than 20.0-inches in length, but two 30.0-inch pike were measured. <br> 
   <br> 
Largemouth Bass and Bluegill densities are low due to scarceness of aquatic vegetation.  Only seventeen Largemouth Bass were captured by all gear types combined in 2014.  The electrofishing catch rate was very low at 6.2 fish/hour.  Electrofishing captures ranged from 12.9 to 16.3 inches in length.  Largemouth Bass grow slow.  Those 16.0 inch captures were at least nine years old.  Bluegill catches averaged only 5.0 fish/trapnet.  Size at capture ranged from 3.1 to 8.5 inches.  Most captures proved to be young fish, age-3 or less, thus average size of bluegill caught in trapnets was 5.4 inches.  Other members of the sunfish family captured during the 2014 survey included Pumpkinseed and sunfish hybrids. <br> 
 <br> 
Black Crappie are more tolerant of limited vegetative coverage than other resident sunfishes.  Grants Lake supports a moderately abundant crappie population.  Survey catches were comprised of cohorts of seven age groups.  Size of captures ranged from 3.9 to 12.1 inches in length.  A comparatively strong year class was produced in 2010.  These fish will exceed 10.0 inches in length in 2015. <br> 
   <br> 
Fair fishing opportunities exist for less popular and under-exploited fishes.  Yellow Bullheads are common.  Gillnet catches in 2014 averaged nearly 2.0 pounds/fish.  Black Bullheads numbers have increased.  Most are young fish.  They averaged 0.5 pounds.  Other non-game fish present include Common Carp, Bowfin and White Sucker.   <br>

 Survey Date = '2015-08-10',  County Name = 'Douglas', Lake Name = 'Ida' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/10/2015 Clarity: 13' 
 Narrative = '<p>Lake Ida is a large (4,427 acres), moderately fertile basin located northwest of Alexandria. Maximum depth exceeds 100 feet. Mean depth is approximately 28 feet. Lake Ida lies within the Long Prairie River watershed and is connected to Lake Miltona to the north and Lake Charley to the south via non- navigable channels. Residential development surrounding the lake is considered moderate to heavy. Water quality and clarity are good. Average water clarity measurements typically exceed 10 feet during summer months.  This lake is a popular destination for both anglers and recreational boaters.  Recreational pressure can be high, especially on weekend days during summer months. Lake Ida supports a complex fish community due to good water quality and exceptional habitat diversity such as shallow bays, rock bars, abundant mid-lake structure, and vast areas of emergent and submergent vegetation. <br> 
 <br> 
Lake Ida is now designated as an infested waterbody due to the presence of zebra mussels, which were first confirmed in 2013. Regulations restricting bait harvest and transport of water apply to this basin. For more information regarding aquatic invasive species in Minnesota see the following:  http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/aquatic/index.html <br> 
 <br> 
Primary fish management is directed at Walleyes.  Annual fry and periodic fingerling stockings are programmed in efforts to supplement natural reproduction.  The Lake Ida Association also stocks Walleye fingerlings by permit.  High Walleye abundance is difficult to sustain in large lakes through supplemental stocking. Successful natural reproduction is key to sustaining quality Walleye fisheries in these waters. Current Walleye abundance is considered high.  In fact, the 2015 catch rate was the highest it has been since the mid-1990s. Mean length and weight of 2015 captures was 16.4 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Recent fall electrofishing surveys and current age structure data suggest moderate to strong year classes have been produced in recent years. Walleye abundance and fishing success are projected to remain strong in coming years as these younger, smaller fish grow into the sport fishery. <br> 
 <br> 
Lake Ida supports both Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass populations.  Largemouth Bass are abundant and anglers can expect good fishing success.  Spring electrofishing catches averaged 11.5 inches.  The largest Largemouth Bass captured measured 18.9 inches.  Smallmouth Bass numbers have increased in recent years. This population typically exhibits lower abundance but larger average size when compared to the largemouth population.  Mean length of Smallmouth Bass captured during the 2015 survey was 16.9 inches.  The largest measured 20.5 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike abundance increased in response to above-average precipitation and high water through the mid- and late-1990s.  Currently, catch rates are higher than what is expected for this type of lake.  Pike exceeding 30.0 inches are present but smaller, slow growing "hammer-handle" pike dominate the population.  An occasional Muskellunge has been captured during lake surveys.  This trophy gamefish is not stocked into Lake Ida, thus abundance is extremely low.  Presence of this species in Lake Ida is likely a result of downstream emigration from Lake Miltona. <br> 
 <br> 
Panfish anglers will encounter an abundant population of Bluegill. Fishing quality for this species is considered fair to good. Mean length of Bluegills captured in 2015 was 5.7 inches.  Angler catches of larger sunfish are common during summer months.  Black Crappie are also abundant.  In fact, record-high crappie abundance was documented in 2015.  Mean and maximum lengths of Black Crappie captured in 2015 were 8.9 and 13.7 inches.  Rock Bass sustain an abundant population and contribute to fishing, but relatively few are harvested. Yellow Perch abundance is low and harvestable-size perch are rare.  Lake Ida also supports opportunities to catch and harvest Tullibee, also referred to as Cisco, and is one of only two lakes in the Glenwood Management Area where sport gill netting for this species is allowed. <br> 
 <br> 
Three lake access sites are available for public use. The north access has limited parking space. This access can also be relatively shallow during low water periods.  Launching of large boats at this site can be challenging.  Boaters should also be cautious of shallow rock bars off of the following points: Pilgrim and Stony (the two points that separate the north and south portions of this basin) and Betsy Ross (the point entering the northwest bay). These areas are posted with caution signs.  There is also a posted fish spawning area, located at the entrance of a bay near Betsy Ross Resort on the northwest  shoreline.  Fishing is prohibited within the posted area during the spring spawning season. <br> 
 <br> 
Fishing pressure can be seasonally heavy, particularly for Black Crappie and Walleye, while other gamefish populations are under-utilized. To help maintain fish community balance and quality fishing experiences, anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest strategies. Selective harvest encourages release of larger fish and increased harvest of more abundant smaller or under-exploited fishes.  Harvest of smaller pike from Lake Ida is highly encouraged to help keep this population in check.  Lower numbers of hammer-handle Northern Pike should also improve survival of young Walleye. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye anglers should exercise restraint while fishing in deep water. Walleyes occupy depths at or in excess of 60 feet in fall, winter, and spring months.  Walleyes caught at depths in excess of 30 feet, or one atmosphere, are subject to water pressure changes that result in over-inflation of their swim bladder which can force their stomach to protrude outside the mouth. The extended gas bladder prevents captured fish from leaving the water surface and moving into deeper water for some time. Delayed mortality of these fish is often high. It is wasteful and counterproductive to management efforts to practice catch and release of Walleyes from deep water. <br> 
 <br> 
Other species captured during the 2015 survey included Bullheads (Brown and Yellow), Bowfin (Dogfish), Common Carp, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, and White Sucker. The next lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2019. <br>

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/17/2015 Clarity: 3.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Indian Lake is a small (99 acre), fertile basin located in north-central Douglas County between the towns of Garfield and Leaf Valley.  The basin has a maximum depth of 38.0 feet.  Water clarity was poor (3.5 feet) at time of the August survey.   <br> 
 <br> 
A standardized fish community assessment was completed on Indian Lake, August 17-20, 2015.  A combination of three gill nets and nine trap nets were used.  The netting component of the survey was preceded with an electrofishing survey to gain estimates of abundance and size structure of the Largemouth Bass population.  This survey was completed on May 22, 2015.   <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth Bass proved to be moderately abundant.  Length of bass captures ranged from 11.1 to 18.7 inches.  Age distribution of the population sample extended from age 5 to age 11.  Due to lack of young bass captures, average size of Largemouth Bass caught during the spring electrofishing survey was 16.0 inches.  Old bass grow slowly.  Few captures exceeded 18.0 inches in total length.   <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike continue to be abundant, but most captures were small with an average length of 21.5 inches.  Two 28.0-inch pike were recorded in the gill net catch.  Only two Walleyes were caught during the netting survey.  This low catch was disappointing given fingerling stocking investments.  Survival of stocked Walleye fingerlings and yearlings appeared very poor.    <br> 
 <br> 
Indian Lake supports a fair panfish fishery.   Bluegills and Black Crappies are abundant, but growth rates are too slow to optimize fishing potential.  Bluegill captures averaged 6.3 inches.  The largest caught measured 8.8 inches.  These larger fish were eight- or nine-years-old.  Black Crappie catches increased in 2015 in response to elevated and fairly consistent natural recruitment in 2010, 2011, and 2012.  Another strong year class was established in 2014.   Due to the high proportion of young fish making up the population sample and slow growth, few crappie captures exceeded 8.0 inches in length.  Cohorts of a strong 2010 year class should approach 10.0 inches in length in 2017.  Yellow Perch abundance has declined in Indian Lake.  None of the perch measured during the 2015 survey exceeded 8.0 inches, thus the population contributes very little to the recreational fishery.  They do constitute a very important food base for predatory gamefishes, namely Northern Pike, Walleye, and Largemouth Bass.  <br> 
 <br> 
Anglers are encouraged to harvest moderate-sized (< 21.0 inches) Northern Pike in an effort to reduce surplus pike densities and improve survival, growth, and yields for other sport fish populations. <br> 
 <br> 
A DNR public access is located on the northern shoreline of Indian Lake just off of Indian Lake Road. <br>

 Survey Date = '2015-07-20',  County Name = 'Douglas', Lake Name = 'Latoka' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/21/2015 Clarity: 15' 
 Narrative = '<p>Lake Latoka is a 767-acre lake located about two miles west of the City of Alexandria.  The basin has a maximum depth of 108.0 feet and average depth of 42.0 feet.  The lake has exceptional water quality.  Summer water transparency measurements within the northern portion of the lake average 13.3 feet.  Total productivity from a fisheries management perspective is moderate due to the lake's limited fertility and littoral area.  Only 35% of the surface area of Lake Latoka is less than 15.0 feet in depth.  This shallow area with sunlight penetration and active aquatic plant growth is considered the most productive area of lakes.  Even with modest carrying capacity, Lake Latoka supports a diverse fish community and good fishing opportunities. <br> 
 <br> 
A standardized fish community survey was completed on July 23, 2015.  Fish sampling gear included trap nets and gill nets.  The netting portion of the survey was augmented with a night electrofishing survey on June 8, 2015, to better estimate abundance and size distribution of the Largemouth Bass population. <br> 
 <br> 
Electrofishing catches of Largemouth Bass were lower than that of prior surveys.  Age distribution of captures extended to age 10, but annual recruitment of young bass into the population appeared limited since 2005.  Bass captures ranged from 9.7 to 18.8 inches and averaged 15.4 inches.  One Smallmouth Bass was captured during the electrofishing survey.  This was the first recorded catch of this gamefish.  Another 19 Smallmouth Bass were captured in nets.  Four age classes were documented in this limited catch, which indicated Lake Latoka now supports a self-sustaining Smallmouth Bass population.  <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike are excessively abundant.  Gill net catches averaged 18.5-pike/net.   Due to the high population density, growth is slow.  Average size of captures was 18.8 inches.  The largest Northern Pike recorded in the 2015 survey measured 32.5 inches.   <br> 
 <br> 
Large Walleye fingerlings and yearlings are stocked to sustain this popular fishery.  A gill net catch rate of 6.5-fish/net describes a moderate population density.  Walleyes grow well in Lake Latoka and age distribution of gill net captures extended to age 18, so the lake can offer good opportunities to catch large Walleyes.  Captures of 25.0-inch and larger Walleyes have been common among all surveys. <br> 
 <br> 
Sunfishes are abundant in Lake Latoka, particularly Bluegills and Pumpkinseed Sunfish.  A relatively high proportion of Bluegill captures were four-years-old or younger, thus average size of Bluegill captures was 5.6 inches.  Due to their excessive abundance, Bluegill growth is too slow to optimize fishing quality potential.  Few 8.0-inch Bluegills have been captured among surveys.  Rock Bass catches during the 2015 survey were also elevated.   Gill net captures averaged 8.6 inches in length.  Many Rock Bass captures exceeded 10.0 inches in length.  Black Crappies are less abundant than other sunfishes, but the population can offer good fishing.  Crappie recruitment was good in 2010.  Those five-year-old crappies captured during the 2015 survey averaged 11.1 inches in length. <br> 
 <br> 
Lake Latoka has the depth and water quality to sustain a Cisco population.  Cisco, commonly called tullibees, is a coldwater fish intolerant of water temperatures exceeding 70 degrees F.  Lake Latoka becomes thermally stratified during summer months.  The thermocline was detected below 30.0 feet at time of the 2015 survey.  There proved to be sufficient dissolved oxygen and cooler water temperatures at this depth during the summer to provide suitable habitat for the Cisco population.  Ciscos are considered high fat, high value prey for Northern Pike and Walleyes.  They also grow large enough to add to the lake's overall fishery.  The largest Cisco captured measured 18.3 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Anglers are strongly encouraged to harvest the surplus of small Northern Pike (< 21.0 inches) to reduce pike density, release some excessive predatory pressure off the Yellow Perch population, and increase survival of stocked Walleyes.  Releasing medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish and should provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future.   <br> 
 <br> 
Lake Latoka is designated as an infested waterbody due to the presence of zebra mussels, which were first confirmed in 2014.  Regulations restricting bait harvest and transport of water apply to this basin.

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2016-08-15',  County Name = 'Douglas', Lake Name = 'Le Homme Dieu' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/15/2016 Clarity: 16' 
 Narrative = '<p>Lake Le Homme Dieu is a 1,800-acre basin located on the northeast city limit of Alexandria and is part of the Alexandria Chain of Lakes.  Navigable connections exist to Lake Carlos and Lake Geneva.  The shoreline and most of the watershed are well developed. Water quality is good.  Water transparency was 16 feet during the 2016 survey.  Because of its clear water and close proximity to Alexandria, the lake is popular with anglers and recreational boaters.  Boating pressure can be high on weekends during the summer.  Two well-maintained accesses are available to the public.  Rotary Beach Access is located on the northwest shoreline off County Road 42.  Krueger's Creek Access is located along the northeast shoreline.  The City of Alexandria maintains a public swimming beach on the southeast shoreline.  Boaters should be cautious of marked navigation hazards on the lake.  A shallow rock bar is located in the middle of the lake off the west shoreline.  Shallow rock areas are also present off both points leading into the west bay (Bugaboo Bay). <br> 
 <br> 
Lake Le Homme Dieu sustains a modest Walleye fishery, which is supplemented with combined fingerling stockings by the DNR and a cooperative arrangement by the Lake Le Homme Dieu Association and Vikings Sportsmen Club, Inc.  Gill net catch rates declined in 2016 to 2.9 Walleye/net.  Average size of Walleyes caught during the survey was 16.4 inches.   <br> 
 <br> 
Lake Le Homme Dieu supports abundant populations of Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Bluegill.  Due to moderate fertility of the lake and moderate to high abundance of these fishes, growth rates can be slow.  Fortunately, gamefishes in Lake Le Homme Dieu live to be quite old, thus it does support some larger fish.  Seventy percent of the Largemouth Bass surveyed during the spring were 12.0 inches or longer.  Some were estimated to be up to 17 years old.  An 8.0-inch Bluegill may be 10 years old.  Few Black Crappie are caught during summer surveys since larger fish move off-shore and are less vulnerable to capture in trap nets.  Low catch rates recorded in surveys does not accurately reflect abundance and size.  Lake Le Homme Dieu does support good crappie fishing.  Yellow Perch numbers have consistently been low. Yellow Perch are preferred prey of Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass.  <br> 
 <br> 
Quality fishing opportunities exist for many species in Lake Le Homme Dieu.  Even modest harvest of older fish can degrade fishing quality.  Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help maintain and improve the quality of the Lake Le Homme Dieu fishery. Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish. Releasing medium to large fish will help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br> 
 <br> 
Lake Le Homme Dieu was designated as an infested water after the discovery of zebra mussels in 2009.  Eurasian watermilfoil was also discovered in 2012.  Minnesota statutes require all equipment be free of invasive species prior to leaving any access.  Recreational users should take necessary precautions to prevent the further spread of invasive species. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2013-07-22',  County Name = 'Douglas', Lake Name = 'Lobster' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/22/2013 Clarity: 8' 
 Narrative = '<p>Lobster Lake is a 1,329-acre natural basin located five miles west of Alexandria.  The lake has a maximum depth of 65.0 feet and an average depth of 15.0 feet.  The unique lobster-shaped basin has a shoreline length of 17.3 miles.  Lobster Lake is a moderately fertile basin.  Water quality and clarity are good.  Summer water transparency measurements average 9.1 feet.  The lake becomes thermally stratified during summer months.  Depth to the thermocline was approximately 15.0 feet at time of the July 22 survey.  Dissolved oxygen concentrations below 18.0 feet were too low to support game fish.   <br> 
 <br> 
The many points, arms, bays, and islands add complexity to basin morphology and provide diverse, high-quality fish habitat.  Submergent and emergent vegetation is common along much of the shoreline, particularly in shallow bays.  Habitat attributes and the many miles of shoreline make Lobster Lake a productive and popular fishing destination. <br> 
 <br> 
Lobster Lake is one of the three lakes within the Glenwood Fisheries Management Area supporting a muskellunge fishery.  Fingerlings are stocked in even-numbered years to compensate for annual mortality and sustain a low-density population of large, prized game fish.  Ice-out netting in May resulted in the capture of 109 muskellunge.  Size of captures varied from 20.7 to 52.0 inches and averagde 41.5 inches.  Size structure will likely improve in the near future as a large proportion (36%) of sampled fish measured between 39.4 and 41.3 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike catches averaged 5.9 fish/gillnet which describes near-average population density for similar lakes.  Length of captures varied from 15.0 to 31.6 inches.  Pike greater than 30.0 inches are rare in Lobster Lake.  Mean length and weight of captures was 21.6 inches and 2.2 pounds.   <br> 
 <br> 
Lobster Lake supports a popular largemouth bass fishery.  Largemouth bass are abundant, but don't grow very rapidly.  Due to poor growth, fishing quality in terms of size of the catch is only fair.  Average length of sampled fish was 10.6 inches in length.  Only 7% of all sampled bass exceeded 15.0 inches.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest the overabundance of small- to medium-sized bass to improve overall growth rates.  Smallmouth bass was sampled first sampled in Lobster Lake in 2013. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye catches in gillnets averaged 5.4 fish/gillnet.  The 2013 catch rate exceeded catch rates from the five preceding surveys.  A moderate increase in population density is partially related to near-annual stockings since 2000.   Sizes of captures varied from 9.1 to 27.0 inches.  Average length and weight of captured walleyes was 14.0 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Similar to largemouth bass and northern pike, walleyes grow slowly.  The oldest walleyes caught were 11 years old.  These three capptures averaged only 21.9 inches in total length. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill catch rates have been inconsistent and may be related to irregular annual recruitment of young fish into the population.  Average trapnet catch rates (20.0 bluegill/net) during the 2013 survey were within the range of expected catches rates for similar lakes.  Bluegills don't grow fast.  Age distribution of the population sample extended to age 11, but none of the captures exceeded 8.0 inches in length.  Average size of sampled bluegills was 6.3 inches.  Anglers can take advantage of a surplus of medium-sized bluegills.  <br> 
  <br> 
Black crappie catches averaged 1.6 fish/trapnet.  This modest catch rate is considered an under-estimate of actual abundance.  Many adult crappies had moved offshore into deeper, cooler water by time of the mid-July survey.  The largest crappie measured was 10.6 inches in length. <br> 
   <br> 
Notes: <br> 
The east end of Lobster Lake is approximately five miles west of Alexandria.  A single public access site is located on the very southwestern end of the lake or approximately 10 miles from Alexandria. <br> 
 <br> 
Lobster Lake was designated as Muskellunge Waters in 1972.  Northern pike spearing was soon prohibited to minimize potential misidentification and spearing mortality of young muskellunge.  The winter spearing restriction was repealed and lifted December 2013. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2013-06-10',  County Name = 'Douglas', Lake Name = 'Maple' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/10/2013 Clarity: 32.2' 
 Narrative = '<p>Maple Lake is a moderate-sized (815 acres), clear water lake located approximately six miles south of Alexandria in Douglas County.  The basin has a maximum depth of 78 feet and average depth of 16 feet.  Due to Maple Lake's large bays, approximately half of the lake area is considered to be a littoral zone, which is that area less than 15 feet in depth.  Maple Lake becomes thermally stratified during summer months.  Dissolved oxygen concentration can be low enough to limit sustained occupation by game fishes below the thermocline.  Depth to the thermocline can vary from 45 feet in early summer to 25 feet in August. <br> 
 <br> 
Water quality is very good.  Water clarity averages 10 feet during summer months due to a small watershed area and comparatively low inputs of total phosphorus from runoff.  Algal blooms can occur but are temporary and rarely severe.   Bottom soils are largely sand.  Silt and sediment deposits occur in the back of bays.  The lake supports a diversity of submergent plants.  Due to clear water, plants have been found growing to a depth of 17 feet.  Yellow water lilies occur in sheltered areas along the western shoreline.  Highly valued hardstem bulrush is largely confined to undeveloped shoreline. <br> 
   <br> 
Maple Lake supports abundant panfish and northern pike populations.  Bluegill sunfishes and black crappies comprise most of the panfish harvest.  Bluegills captured during the study averaged 6.8 inches.  Only five percent of bluegills captured in trap nets were 8.0-inches or larger.  These proved to be old fish. An 8-inch bluegill is 10-years-old.   Black crappie catches were high during the 2013 survey in response to establishment of a very strong year class in 2009.  These four-year-old fish made up 87% of the total crappie caught in trap nets and averaged 9.4 inches during the June survey.  Elevated crappie abundance is also partially attributable to a crappie harvest regulation limiting daily harvest to five fish over 10 inches in total length. <br> 
 <br> 
The fish community is top heavy with predators.  Northern pike are too abundant.  Gillnet catches averaged 20.5 pike/net.  Captures ranged from 11.0  30.0 inches and averaged 18.4 inches.  Largemouth bass are less abundant, but due to limited fertility of the lake and stiff competition with other predators, bass grow slowly.  Poor growth diminishes potential fishing quality in terms of size.  The largest bass caught measured 16.9 inches.  Average length of bass captures was 12.6 inches.  Walleyes are stocked to satisfy demand for this popular fishery.  Stocking performance and annual recruitment of young walleyes into the population has proven to be inconsistent.  Catch statistics from the 2013 survey described a good walleye fishery.  Walleye gillnet catches averaged 9.5 fish/net.  This catch rate exceeds expectations from similar lakes in Minnesota.  Average length of walleye captures was 14.0 inches.  Relatively few 20 inch and larger walleye were measured.  The largest walleye caught was 23.0 inches in length.   This fish was estimated to be thirteen-years-old. <br> 
   <br> 
Harvest of the surplus of 21.0-inch and smaller pike would be beneficial to improve predator/prey balance and productivity of the fishery.  Yellow perch, preferred prey for bass, pike, and walleyes, are in short supply.  If faced with limited perch, predators will shift their diet to young of other gamefishes or less energy-efficient food sources.  Young walleye are an acceptable alternative for perch. <br> 
 <br> 
Notes: <br> 
 <br> 
Maple Lake's clear water, close proximity to Alexandria, Glenwood, and Forada, and extension of central sewer lines around the lake have stimulated accelerated shoreline development and increased recreational use.  Temporary declines in water quality are evident following weekends of heavy boating activity.  Shoreline development has increasingly encroached into shallow bays and along shoreline supporting hardstem bulrush.  Such habitat provides important spawning, nursery, and feeding sites for gamefishes.  Anglers, recreational boaters, and shoreline property owners should be sensitive to cumulative impacts of aquatic resources and endeavor to minimize water quality degradation and habitat fragmentation. <br> 
 <br> 
Zebra mussels were found in Maple Lake in 2013.  Property owners indicate this undesired invasive has successfully reproduced.  Please drain boats, bait buckets, and other water containers when leaving the lake to reduce the risk of moving zebra mussels and other non-native organisms to uninfested waters. <br> 
 <br> 
Two improved public access sites are located on north and east shorelines.  A handicapped accessible, floating fishing pier has been installed near the north boat launch for shore-based fishing experiences. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2013-08-12',  County Name = 'Douglas', Lake Name = 'Mary' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/19/2013 Clarity: 3' 
 Narrative = '<p>Lake Mary is a large, popular fishing lake located four miles southwest of Alexandria.  It has a surface area of 2,450 acres and shoreline length of 11.7 miles.  Maximum depth is 40.0 feet.  Average depth is 17.0.  Water transparency has declined over the past two decades to average 6.2 feet during summer months.  Algae blooms are common and can be anticipated after strong winds.  Fortunately, such blooms are short-lived.  Fish habitat conditions are changing to favor less vegetation-dependent gamefishes such as walleye and black crappie, but Lake Mary continues to support a well-rounded fishery. <br> 
 <br> 
Lake Mary is well known for quality walleye fishing.  Walleyes are abundant.  Walleye fry are stocked on an alternate-year basis to supplement natural reproduction.  Gillnet catches during the 2013 survey averaged 10.0 walleyes/net.  The population has a broad age distribution.  Captures ranged from 8.0 to 27.4 inches in length, but averaged only 13.9 inches due to the relatively high proportion of young fish making up the population sample.  On average, young walleyes grow to exceed 15.0 inches by age 4 and quickly recruit to the harvestable segment of the population. <br> 
 <br> 
Record black crappie catches occurred during the 2013 survey.  Lengths of captures ranged from 3.7 to 12.2 inches.  Multiple age groups were represented in the catch.  Elevated catches were mostly attributable to establishment of a very strong year class in 2010.  These three-year-old fish made up 90% of all crappies captured in trapnets.  Average length at capture was 8.6 inches.  Cohorts of this year class will grow to approach 10.0 inches in late 2014.  <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth bass, northern pike, and bluegill populations can be described as "moderate densities of medium-sized fish".  Largemouth bass averaged 14.3 inches in length at capture.  Thirty-seven percent of the electrofishing catch was 15.0 inches and larger.  No 18.0-inch or larger bass were measured.  Northern pike catches averaged a healthy 6.0 fish/gillnet.  Length at capture ranged from 14.7 to 30.0 inches and averaged 20.4 inches.  Most pike were young fish between three- and five-years-old. Six percent of the gillnet catch exceeded 28.0 inches.  Size structure of the bluegill population sample was strongly influenced by establishment of a very strong year class in 2008.  These age-5 captures comprised 67% of bluegill catch.  Average size of captures was 6.8 inches.  In contrast to preceding survey records, no sampled bluegill exceeded 8.0 inches in length.  Based on past age and growth information, bluegills have potential to grow larger, but they face significant harvest pressure before reaching eight years of age.   <br> 
 <br> 
Notes: <br> 
Zebra mussels were found in Lake Mary in 2013.  Please drain all water from your boat and other containers to prevent transfer of this and other aquatic invasive species to other lakes. <br> 
 <br> 
Two public accesses are available.  The access located on the north shore is relatively shallow and is not conducive to launching larger boats, especially during years with lower water levels. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2012-06-11',  County Name = 'Douglas', Lake Name = 'Mill' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/11/2012 Clarity: 6.2' 
 Narrative = '<p>Mill Lake is a 461-acre, moderately developed basin located about eight miles southwest of Alexandria in Douglas County.  Maximum depth is 40.0 ft.  Mean depth is 20.0 ft.   Water clarity averages about 7.0 feet during summer months.  Monitoring records describe a gradual increase in water clarity over the past 20 years.   <br> 
 <br> 
The lake is fertile and supports an abundant and diverse aquatic plant community.  Emergent vegetation such as hardstem bulrush is common and helps protect shorelines from erosion while also providing valuable fish and wildlife habitat.  Bulrush is effective at absorbing in-lake nutrients that would otherwise fuel the growth of nuisance algae.  Submergent plants growth to a depth of 12.0 feet. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleyes, northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegills and black crappies are moderately abundant.  Walleyes captured during the 2012 survey ranged from 10.0- to 29.0-inches and averaged almost 16-inches.  These 16-inch fish are part of a strong 2008 year class that should provide good angling in 2013.  Northern pike captures ranged from 12.0- to 32.0-inches in length.  At present, most pike are young.  Due to the high proportion of young fish in the population sample, average size captured in gillnets was 20.3 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Habitat conditions are well suited for sunfishes.  The black crappie population supports a popular spring fishery.  Survey catch rates have often exceeded normal or expected catches for similar lakes.  Reproductive success and annual recruitment have proven irregular, thus age and size distributions, as well as, fishing quality can vary dependent upon loss of old fish or variable contributions of young fish to population abundance.  Largemouth bass are very abundant.  Older bass don't grow well, thus the lake doesn't support many bass over 15.0 inches in length.  Most bluegills captured during the 2012 survey were three-year-old fish.   Average size caught in 2012 was 5.8 inches, but 8.0 inch and larger bluegills are present. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch, the preferred forage for top predators, are currently plentiful.  Perch have adapted to predation by maturing earlier and at a smaller size.  Rather than putting energy into maximal growth, available protein goes into reproduction.  Few perch are large enough to harvest. <br> 
 <br> 
In summary, Mill Lake can best be described as relatively quiet, highly productive lake that retains a good amount of natural shoreline and areas of emergent vegetation.  The lake has lush submergent plant growth and can become a bit green during the height of summer.  Gamefishes are abundant and angler catch rates can be very good.  Mill Lake offers excellent family fishing experiences and can also yield some large walleye for specialized anglers. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2014-07-14',  County Name = 'Douglas', Lake Name = 'Mina' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/14/2014 Clarity: 13' 
 Narrative = '<p>Lake Mina is a deep, 424-acre lake located approximately four miles west of Alexandria. Maximum depth is 123 feet.  Water clarity is excellent.  Water transparency averages 11.9 feet in summer months.  Basin morphology is characterized by small bays, separated by shallow reefs and steep drop-offs.  Chara or muskgrass carpets much of the shallows.  The lake is mostly fringed by cattail and bulrush.  Despite the lake's limited fertility, it does become thermally stratified during summer months.  The thermocline was detected below 20.0 feet during the July 2014 survey.  Due to low dissolved oxygen concentrations in deep water in summer months, most gamefishes are confined to that the portion of the lake less than 25.0 feet in depth. <br> 
 <br> 
Lake Mina is a quiet, relatively scenic lake that can provide enjoyable, family-oriented fishing experiences.  Common gamefishes present in Lake Mina include Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, Bluegill, and Walleye.  <br> 
  <br> 
Members of the sunfish family, specifically Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie, tend to be abundant.  Due to low fertility of the lake and intense competition for food, these fish grow slow.  Most captures will be comprised of small- to medium-size fish.  Average size of Largemouth Bass captured during the spring 2014 electrofishing survey was 9.8 inches.  Based on age and growth calculations, bass don't attain 10.0 inches in length until age 5.  Older, 11-year-old bass captures in the 2014 population sample were only 13.0 inches in length.  Bluegill may not grow to 6.0 inches in length until age 6.  No 8.0-inch or larger Bluegills were captured in 2014.  The largest Black Crappie caught in 2014 was 11.1 inches.   This fish was seven-years-old and likely near the end of its life expectancy.  Other sunfishes common to Lake Mina include Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and sunfish hybrids.  Anglers should not be reluctant to harvest from surplus stocks of bass and panfishes. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike densities have decreased through the 2000s, but this under-exploited gamefish remains abundant.  Pike captures during the 2014 survey varied from 13.3 inches to 28.7 inches in length and averaged 19.4 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Large Walleye fingerlings are stocked into Lake Mina on an alternate-year frequency to sustain a modest fishery.  Walleye catches in 2014 averaged 5.1 fish/gillnet.  Ten age classes were represented in the population sample.  Age distribution was estimated to extend to age 15.  In contrast to most other gamefishes in Lake Mina, Walleye growth is above average.  Walleye attain a harvestable size of 17.0 inches by age 4.  Average size of Walleyes captured was 18.6 inches.  Angling catch rates may be modest, but Lake Mina can give up memorable-size fish.  The largest Walleye caught during the 2014 survey measured 28.3 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
Anglers fishing Lake Mina may also encounter Muskellunge.  A single Muskellunge stocking occurred in 1971.  A low-density population continues to persist through probable downstream movements from Lobster Lake.  None were captured during the July 2014 fish community assessment.  Five Muskellunge were captured during an ice-out population assessment completed in 2008.  The largest capture measured 47.3 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Cisco, a deep-water fish that prefers cold, well-oxygenated water can be found in Lake Mina.  They are an excellent indicator species of overall water quality. <br> 
 <br> 
Lake Mina is now designated as an infested waterbody due to the presence of zebra mussels in connected upstream lakes.  Regulations restricting bait harvest and transport of water apply to this basin.

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2016-07-05',  County Name = 'Douglas', Lake Name = 'Pocket' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/05/2016 Clarity: 4.75' 
 Narrative = '<p>Pocket Lake is a 275-acre lake located approximately 10 miles southwest of Alexandria.  The basin has a maximum depth of 40 feet and an average depth of approximately 15 feet.  The lake exists in a eutrophic state in response to excessive nutrient delivery from the watershed and internal nutrient cycling during summer months.  Water transparency measures during summer months from 2008 to 2016 have averaged 5.7 feet.  Occasional nuisance algal blooms can occur.  Due to depth and fertility, the lake becomes thermally stratified during the summer. While thermally stratified, dissolved oxygen concentrations may be too low to support fish life below the thermocline.  The thermocline occurred at approximately 17.0 feet during the July 2016 standardized fisheries survey.  Much of the lake's submergent vegetation occurs in the shallow, northern end of the lake.  Habitat conditions can be seasonally harsh for cool water gamefishes and sight-feeding predators.  Even with such challenges, Pocket Lake can offer good fishing opportunities and quieter fishing experiences than other lakes near Alexandria.   <br> 
 <br> 
The most recent fisheries survey was completed in 2016.  Survey methodology included spring electrofishing on May 24 to assess Largemouth Bass population abundance and size structure.  Gill and trap nets were set from July 5-7 to best capture and estimate abundance, age structure, growth, and size distribution of other gamefishes.    <br> 
 <br> 
Similar to preceding survey results, Black Crappies proved to be very abundant.  Size of captures extended to 10.9 inches.  Most crappie captures were two- or three-year-old fish, thus average size of captures in trap nets was only 5.8 inches.  These population attributes were very similar to that of Bluegill Sunfish.  Trap net catches of Bluegills were elevated.  Age distribution of captures extended to age 8, but most of the total catch was comprised of two- and three-year-old individuals.  Rate of growth of Bluegills is a little too slow to optimize fishing potential.  Older captures were just reaching 8.0 inches in length at age 7.  With a maximum age of eight-years-old, the relative proportion of 8.0-inch and larger Bluegill captures during this and past surveys has been limited.  The largest Bluegill measured during the 2016 survey was 8.6 inches in total length.  Yellow Perch were moderately abundant, but captures were too small to contribute to the panfishery.  Average length of perch caught in gill nets was 6.4 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleyes are stocked to sustain this popular fishing opportunity.  Twenty-two Walleyes were captured in gill nets, which yielded a modest catch rate of 3.7 fish/net.  Sizes at capture ranged from 11.1 to 22.9 inches and averaged 16.4 inches.  Northern Pike are more abundant, but in absence of cisco and a coolwater refuge during summer months, growth potential is diminished.  Pike catches ranged from 10.3 to 30.3 inches in length.  Average length was 21.9 inches.  Largemouth Bass catches during the spring electrofishing survey were lower than anticipated based on past survey results.  Annual recruitment of young bass into the population appeared to be limited from 2009 through 2012.  Most bass captures were young fish determined to be two- or three-years-old or older individuals either eight- or nine-years-old.  Average length at capture was 9.6 inches.  The largest bass captured by electrofishing measured 16.5 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Catch statistics generated from the 2016 survey would tend to describe only fair fishing because of the high proportion of young sunfishes (Largemouth Bass, Bluegills, and Black Crappies) in the total catch.  Fishing experiences might best be described as high catch rates, but a small average size.  Fish quality expressed in terms of average size of captures should improve markedly as those young fish grow to preferred sizes.  Anglers are encouraged to target the surplus of 22.0-inch and smaller Northern Pike and practice catch and release of larger, older predators to maintain or enhance predator-prey balance and fish quality.   <br> 
 <br> 
A DNR public access is located on the far south end of the lake.  Zebra mussels were found in Pocket Lake in 2016.  Anglers and recreational boaters are urged to thoroughly clean and disinfect watercraft after use and avoid transporting water and invasive species to other non-infested basins.  <br>

Strong wind and wave action can re-suspend nutrients tied up in bottom sediments and trigger frequent and severe algal blooms.  Red Rock Lake is a polymictic lake.  It can become thermally stratified during the summer, but strong winds can break down the thermocline and allow the top warm water layer and cool deeper water to mix.  During those periods during which the lake is thermally stratified, dissolved oxygen concentrations may be too low in deeper water to support fish.  Dissolved oxygen concentrations were too low below 17.0 feet to support gamefishes in early June of 2014. <br> 
 <br> 
Red Rock's fish community has been strongly impacted and shaped by water level instability.  Much of the hardstem bulrush ringing the shoreline and most submergent vegetation was lost to inundation and extended high water following heavy precipitation in the mid-1980s and again in the mid-1990s.  Outlet modifications have occurred to lower and stabilize the water level, but with weather extremes, lake elevation among years has varied by as much as 5.5 feet.  Such habitat instability, limited water clarity, and variability in diversity and coverage of aquatic plants can have profound influences on natural recruitment of nesting gamefishes, survival of young fish in absence of nursery and escape cover, and feeding efficiency of predators.  Those fishes most at risk include sight feeding predators such as Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass and sunfishes.  Relatively stable water levels in recent years has been conducive to growth of submergent vegetation in the main basin and connected wetland basins in the southern watershed area.   <br> 
 <br> 
Despite harsh water quality and habitat conditions, Red Rock Lake supports quality fishing opportunities.  Northern Pike density has increased.  Gillnet catches in 2014 averaged 8.8 fish/net which was the highest catch rate recorded among all surveys.  Pike catches averaged 25.5 inches in length and 3.7 pounds.  Thirty percent of sampled fish exceeded 28.0 inches.  Two captures exceeded 36.0 inches in length.   <br> 
 <br> 
A quality Largemouth Bass fishery has re-established after a population collapse that corresponded to loss of aquatic vegetation.  Bass are now moderately abundant.  Ninety-two percent of electrofishing captures in 2014 exceeded 15.0 inches in length.  The largest bass caught was 20.7 inches in length.   <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill catches increased with better and relatively consistent annual recruitment since 2008. Most captures were relatively young, but due to fast growth, the population can support good fishing.  Bluegills grow to 6.0 inches by age 3 and exceed 8.0 inches by age 5.  In response to fast growth, average size of Bluegill caught was 7.0 inches.  Eleven percent of captures exceeded 8.0 inches in total length.  One capture measured 10.2 inches. <br> 
   <br> 
Black Crappie numbers have also increased, particularly with establishment of a very strong year class of young fish in 2012.  Five age classes were detected in the population sample.  Two-year-old captures made up 83% of the total catch.  Average length was only 6.5 inches because of the high proportion of young fish in the population.  If rate of growth is near average, the two-year-olds should approach 10.0 inches in length in 2016.   <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye are stocked during odd-numbered years to sustain a modest fishery.  Gillnet catches during the 2014 survey averaged 4.4 fish/net.  This catch rate is reasonably good for lakes assigned to Lake Class 38.  Based on age distribution of the 2014 gillnet catch, natural recruitment may account for much of the standing stock.  The population sample was comprised of cohorts of five age classes. Well over half of all captures were age-4 fish.  No stocking was programmed in 2010.  Rate of growth is dependent upon density so cohorts of the strong 2010 year class did not grow as fast as fish in other age classes.  Those four-year-olds did approach 15.0 inches in length at time of the June 2014 survey.  Average size of Walleyes caught was 15.5 inches. <br> 
  <br> 
Red Rock Lake is one of few basins within the Glenwood Management Area that supports a Yellow Perch fishery, but this fishery may be near collapse.  Yellow Perch abundance remains stable, however, numbers of large perch continue to decline with harvest and predation.  Forty percent of perch captures in 2010 exceeded 10.0 inches in length.  One percent of captures exceeded 10.0 inches in 2014.  At increasing Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass densities, perch will likely mature earlier and channel more energy into reproductive processes rather than body growth.    <br> 
 <br> 
Red Rock Lake does not have any known infestations of aquatic invasive species.  If you suspect a new infestation of an invasive plant or animal, take a photo, note the location, or save a specimen and report it to a local DNR invasive species contact at http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/ais/contacts.html. <br> 
 <br> 
Anglers should note that launching a boat during late summer can be challenging due to the shallow access. <br>

 Survey Date = '2010-07-26',  County Name = 'Douglas', Lake Name = 'Smith' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/26/2010 Clarity: 3.5' 
 Narrative = '<p> <br> 
Smith Lake is a 575-acre basin located between Alexandria and Osakis.  Maximum depth is 30.0 ft.  Mean depth is 15.0 ft.  Water clarity is impaired during summer months due to periodic algal blooms stimulated by excessive total phosphorus concentrations and seasonal die-off of curly-leaf pondweed.  A public access is located on the east shoreline. <br> 
	 <br> 
In spite of seasonal impairments, the fish community in Smith Lake is diverse and supports good fishing opportunities.  Habitat attributes are typical of a "bass-panfish" lake.  Primary gamefishes include walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye are stocked every other year (odd numbered years) to sustain a viable fishery.  Catches during the 2010 assessment averaged 4.9 walleye/gill net.  Mean weight of walleye was 2.7 lbs.  Growth rate is excellent with age-4 fish averaging 17.6 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike catches averaged 5.7 fish/gill net.  Average weight was 1.6 lbs.  Only two northern pike out of 51 captures exceeded 24.0 inches. Age-4 northern pike averaged 20.5 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill are very abundant.  Growth is correspondingly slow.  Older bluegill captured did not exceed 6.0 inches in length until age 7.  Eighty-nine percent of bluegill captures were between 5.5 and 7.5 inches.  Average length was 6.4 inches.  Anglers are encouraged  to harvest small sunfish to improve growth and size structure of the remaining population.  <br> 
 <br> 
Smith Lake has long sustained an abundance of black crappie. Unfortunately, crappie don't grow very fast and most succumb to old age before growing to 10.0 inches.  Anglers can anticipate relatively high catch rates of medium-size crappie.  Eighty percent of trap net captures were less than 9.0 inches long.  Average length of crappie caught during the 2010 survey was 8.3 inches.   <br> 
 <br> 
Electrofishing was used to sample the bass population. Results indicate that largemouth bass are moderately abundant. Length frequency distribution describes a good size structure. Mean length of largemouth bass was 13.8 inches.   <br>

 Survey Date = '2013-06-24',  County Name = 'Douglas', Lake Name = 'Stowe' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/24/2013 Clarity: 9.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Stowe Lake is a 376-acre shallow basin located two miles northwest of Brandon in Douglas County. The basin has a maximum depth of 14.0 feet and averages 10.0 feet.  Water quality is seasonally poor in response to algae blooms stimulated by excessive phosphorous loading.  Strong winds and wave actions can also re-suspend fine silts and recycle nutrients.  Water transparency measurements averaged 5.6 feet during summers of 2008 and 2009.  Average total phosphorus measurements approached the water quality impairment standard of 60 ug/L.  Excessive nutrient loads stem from Stowe Lake's very large, well-drained watershed.  Hoplin Creek enters the lake on the east side and delivers water from Big and Little Chippewa and Devils Lake.  Runoff from Stockhausen, Stockhaven, and Upper and Lower Hunt Lakes is carried by Wolf Creek which outlets to Stowe Lake from the north.   <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye fry or fingerlings have been stocked on a biennial frequency to supplement limited natural recruitment and sustain greater abundance.  Walleye gillnet catches averaged 7.7 fish/net which is well within the range of expected catches for similar lakes.  The population has a broad size distribution.  Gillnet captures ranged from 7.1 to 29.6 inches.  Average length of the catch was 14.0 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike catches were higher than expected, averaging 13.7 fish/gillnet. This catch rate is the highest recorded among all preceding surveys.  The pike catch averaged 20.9 inches and had an average weight of 2.2 lbs.  The lake also supported some large pike.  Three fish exceeded 36.0 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappies are more tolerant of seasonally poor water clarity and limited aquatic plants than other sunfishes.   The crappie population proved to be abundant.  Size distribution of the population sample was also very good.  Over 60% percent of crappies caught were over 10.0 inches in length. Average size was 8.9 inches and 0.5 lbs.  Bluegill sunfish catches were modest in comparison to other clear water lakes, but the trapnet catch rate of 10.2-bluegills/net is good for Stowe Lake.  Average size of bluegills measured was 6.5 inches and 0.25 lbs.  The largest bluegill caught measured 9.9 inches.  While not abundant, the largemouth bass population offers quality fishing opportunity.  Average size of electrofishing captures was 11.8 inches. Nearly 30% of bass measured exceeded 15.0 inches in length.  The largest bass capture measured 18.2 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch catches were greater than anticipated given relatively high predator densities.  Harvestable-size perch were rare.  Average length was 6.4 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
A significant change in fish community structure was evident.  Black bullheads dominated gillnet catches through the 2007 survey.  None were caught in 2013.  Environmental factors limiting bullhead recruitment and survival are uncertain. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2014-06-16',  County Name = 'Douglas', Lake Name = 'Vermont' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/23/2014 Clarity: 15.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Vermont Lake is a 307-acre, clear water lake located in northern Douglas County.  Maximum depth is 59.0 feet.  Average depth is estimated at 12.0 feet.  While the lake is relatively small and has relatively low water fertility, the lake has significant bottom relief and a diverse mix of fish habitat along its irregularly shaped shoreline and many bay areas.  Water transparency averages 15.0 feet during summer months.  Aquatic vegetation can be found growing as deep as 20.0 feet, thus most of the lake area less than 15.0 feet in depth supports aquatic plant life.  The lake becomes thermally stratified during summer months.  A thermocline was noted near 36.0 feet at the time of the late-June survey.  Dissolved oxygen levels below the thermocline were too low to support sport fish species.    <br> 
 <br> 
Physical and biological attributes of the lake are most characteristic of "bass-panfish" lakes.  Largemouth Bass and Bluegill are abundant or even overly abundant.  Due to elevated population densities, growth rates are slow.  Even though life spans of these gamefish can extend beyond age 10, anglers can anticipate high catches of small- and medium-size fish.  Bass captures in 2014 ranged from 5.2 to 16.4 inches in length and averaged 10.4 inches.  Bluegill catches averaged 6.0 inches.  Size structure of the catch in 2014 was better than that of past surveys.  Twelve percent of captures in trapnets exceeded 8.0 inches.  The largest Bluegill capture measured 9.1 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike are also abundant in Vermont Lake.  Pike catch rates during 2008 and 2014 surveys have exceeded expectations for lakes of similar habitat attributes.  Gillnet catches during the 2014 survey averaged 14.2 fish/net.  Average size of captures was 17.0 inches.  The largest pike caught measured 31.9 inches in length. <br> 
 <br> 
Lake Vermont supported low-density populations of Black Crappie and Walleye at time of the 2014 survey.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked, but early survival and recruitment of young Walleye into the fishery has been poor.  Annual recruitment of young Black Crappie has also been irregular.  Six Black Crappie and seven Walleye were captured during the 2014 survey.  The largest Walleye captured measured 21.5 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Generalist anglers should take advantage of a harvestable surplus of Yellow Bullheads.  This under-utilized fish is moderately abundant.  Twelve-inch captures were common during the survey.  <br> 
 <br> 
Productivity of the fishery is diminished due to limited fertility of the lake and a predator/prey imbalance.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest small- and moderate-sized Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill to reduce abundances and improve growth rates of remaining individuals.  Harvest of numerous small Northern Pike may also improve success of Walleye stockings. <br> 
 <br> 
Lake Vermont does not currently support any of the most common invasive plant (Eurasian watermilfoil) or animal species (Common Carp, zebra mussels).  Anglers are encouraged to drain water from boats and gear to minimize the risk of introducing these invasive species into this unique lake. <br> 
 <br> 
One public access is located on the east side of Lake Vermont.  <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2015-06-29',  County Name = 'Douglas', Lake Name = 'Winona' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/29/2015 Clarity: 1.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Lake Winona is located within the city limits of Alexandria.  It has a surface area of 213 acres, maximum depth of 9.0 feet, and estimated average depth near 5.0 feet.  The lake and much of the watershed exist within an urban or suburban land use environment.  Recreational uses are currently impaired due to nutrient enrichment.  Primary sources of excessive phosphorus include stormwater runoff from the City of Alexandria and treated wastewater effluents from the Alexandria Lakes Areas Sanitary District treatment plant.  Water transparency measurements during summer months typically do not exceed 2.0 feet due to algae blooms. <br> 
 <br> 
A standardized fish community assessment was completed June 29-July 1, 2015, to determine diversity of fishes present, estimate abundance of gamefishes, and assess fishing potential of Lake Winona. Survey gear and effort included two gill nets, six trap nets, and electrofishing to better sample Largemouth Bass. <br> 
 <br> 
Due to harsh habitat conditions, the greatest total weight of fishes captured was comprised of tolerant fishes, namely White Suckers, Common Carp, and Black Bullheads.  Only one Largemouth Bass was captured during the electrofishing survey.  No Northern Pike were captured.  Very poor water clarity and limited aquatic vegetation diminish feeding efficiency of these sight-feeding predators. <br> 
 <br> 
Lake Winona can offer fair fishing opportunities.  Black Crappies proved to be very abundant.  Both gill net and trap net catches exceeded expectations for similar basins.  The crappie population sample was made up of six age groups.  Lengths of captured crappies ranged from 3.8 to 10.2 inches.  Average length of captures was 7.8 inches.  Fishing quality should improve as cohorts of a strong 2010 year class approach 10.0 inches in length.   <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill catch rates describe a modest population density.  Most captures were young fish, ages 1 and 4, so fishing quality attributes were not great.  Bluegills do appear to grow well and if longevity increases, some proportion of the bluegill population should attain 8.0 inches in length.   <br> 
 <br> 
Two Walleyes were captured in gill nets.  Both fish exceeded 18.0 inches in length.  More Walleyes were observed during the electrofishing survey.  Walleye are not stocked into Lake Winona.  Their presence is likely the result of emigration from connected lakes Agnes and Henry.  <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch catches were high, but average length was 6.3 inches.  No harvestable size perch were measured at time of the survey.  <br> 
 <br> 
There is a public boat access located near the southwest end of the lake off Melvina Lane SW.  Anglers utilizing powered watercraft are reminded that operation is restricted to "slow, no visible wake". <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2015-06-22',  County Name = 'Freeborn', Lake Name = 'Albert Lea' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/24/2015 Clarity: 4' 
 Narrative = '<p>Albert Lea Lake is a 2,654 acre lake located in Freeborn County near the city of Albert Lea. A city-maintained public access is located in town on the northwest corner of the lake. A DNR-maintained public accesses is located on the south side of the lake at Saint Nicholas Landing along County Road 19. Another public access is located within Myre Big Island State Park. Albert Lea Lake is a large, shallow lake with a maximum depth of 5.5 feet and an average depth of only 3.5 feet. Albert Lea Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Yellow Perch and Black Crappie. Walleye fry are stocked every other year at a rate of 1,000 fry per acre (about 2.6 million fry). The shallow, fertile waters of Albert Lea Lake are subject to periodic winterkill events. The most recent partial winterkill took place during the winter of 2013-14. After such events, Walleye fry and Yellow Perch adults are stocked during the following spring. Situations like this are managed as "boom and bust" fisheries, since fish survival is typically high due to reduced predators in the system and fish grow relatively fast after a winterkill due to reduced competition for resources. The "boom" years are typically 2-3 years post-winterkill, while the "bust" years are 0-1 year post-winterkill. Recent stocking events in Albert Lea include Walleye fry stocking in 2015, 2014 (following partial winterkill), 2013, 2011, and 2009. About 3,675 Yellow Perch adults were also stocked in 2014 after the partial winterkill. Albert Lea Lake was surveyed the week of June 22, 2015 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying six gill nets and twelve trap nets throughout the lake, as well as recording water quality parameters. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye <br> 
The Walleye gill net catch rate in the 2015 survey was 12.0 fish/net, which was less than the long-term average of 34.3 fish/net. This long-term average is highly influenced by the 2006 gill net catch rate (60.5 Walleye/net) which resulted from a very strong 2004 year class following a significant winterkill. Also, the 2015 catch rate may not accurately represent the 2014 year class, as many age-1 Walleye may not have recruited to gill nets yet. Walleye abundance in Albert Lea Lake has remained highly variable throughout the past decade, ranging from 12.0 to 60.0 fish/gill net since 2005. This is largely due to periodic winterkills and the successful year classes that follow. The 2015 survey produced two main year classes of Walleye; age-1 (stocked in 2014) and age-2 (stocked in 2013). The average length of age-1 Walleye was 9.8 inches, while the average length of age-2 Walleye was 14.9 inches. Two age-4 individuals were sampled in the survey and averaged about 17.3 inches. The overall average length of all Walleyes sampled throughout this survey was 12.1 inches with less than 15% measuring 16.0 inches or longer. This relatively small size structure was indicative of a lake that was two years removed from a partial winterkill. The Walleye size structure should continue to improve throughout the next couple of years.  <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch <br> 
Yellow Perch was the most abundant fish species observed in the 2015 survey, averaging 173.0 fish/gill net and 44.6 fish/trap net. This exceeded the long-term average for Yellow Perch gill net catch rates in Albert Lea Lake (148.7 fish/net) and was the highest gill net catch rate on record. Although catch rates were high, the Yellow Perch size structure was relatively small. Total lengths ranged from 5.2 to 9.7 inches and averaged 7.1 inches. Most fish (74%) measured less than 7.0 inches. The Yellow Perch population in Albert Lea Lake had a fast growth rate, which was likely influenced by the partial winterkill in 2014. Yellow Perch averaged 5.5 inches by age-1 and 7.9 inches by age-2. Only two age groups were sampled in the 2015 survey (age-1 and age-2), suggesting a young Yellow Perch population on the rebound after the recent partial winterkill. With a very high abundance of young, fast growing Yellow Perch in the lake, anglers should expect great perch fishing at Albert Lea Lake. <br> 
 <br> 
Black Crappie <br> 
The Black Crappie gill net catch rate in the 2015 survey was 14.5 fish/gill net, which was near the long-term average for Albert Lea Lake (16.0 fish/gill net). The trap net catch rate was 22.9 fish/trap net, which was below the average since 2005 (25.5 fish/trap net). Most of the fish were small, averaging just 4.8 inches and ranging from 3.2 to 8.7 inches. Most fish sampled in the 2015 survey were age-1 (91%), so overall size structure should improve as this year class moves through the system. Black Crappies are not stocked in Albert Lea Lake, so the population exists from natural reproduction. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike <br> 
The Northern Pike population in Albert Lea Lake remained in low abundance. The 2015 gill net catch rate was 1.7 fish/gill net, which exceeded the long-term average for Albert Lea Lake (1.2 fish/gill net). Only six fish were sampled in trap nets in 2015 (0.5 fish/trap net). Despite the low abundance, the size of Northern Pike was moderate. The average length of Northern Pike from both gear types was 23.7 inches, ranging from 16.3 to 34.4 inches. Typical of southern Minnesota lakes, Northern Pike in Albert Lea Lake exhibited fast growth rates. Average length at capture was 16.8 inches at age-1, 19.0 inches at age-2, 24.4 inches at age-3, 29.7 inches at age-4, and 33.3 inches at age-5. Northern Pike are not stocked in Albert Lea Lake, so the population persists through natural reproduction or movement from connected Fountain Lake. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill <br> 
The Bluegill population in Albert Lea also remained in low abundance. The Bluegill trap net catch rate in 2015 was 5.3 fish/trap net, which was greater than the long-term average for Albert Lea Lake (4.1 fish/trap net). The Bluegill size structure was small, with about 94% of the trap net catch measuring less than 6.0 inches. About 71% of the Bluegills sampled in trap nets were age-1, indicating a young population. Average length at capture was 3.5 inches at age-1, 4.9 inches at age-2, and 6.0 inches at age-3. Since Albert Lea Lake is often windswept and lacks aquatic vegetation that Bluegill prefer, the Bluegill population in Albert Lea Lake will likely remain in low abundance. <br> 
 <br> 
Black Bullhead <br> 
The partial winterkill of 2014 apparently did not have a large impact on the Black Bullhead population, as catch rates increased since the 2010 survey in both gear types. The catch rates for the 2015 survey were 97.2 fish/gill net and 59.5 fish/trap net. Both catch rates are greater than the average for Albert Lea Lake since 2005 (89.0 fish/gill net and 53.6 fish/trap net). The average length of all Black Bullheads sampled in this survey was 7.2 inches, with the largest measuring 12.6 inches. Black Bullheads are tolerant of low oxygen levels, making them less susceptible to winterkill than game fish species. <br> 
 <br> 
Other Species <br> 
Channel Catfish were present in Albert Lea Lake, although in low abundance. The 2015 survey yielded a total of 5 Channel Catfish among all gear types. The average length of Channel Catfish was 23.0 inches, with the largest individual measuring 30.0 inches. Channel Catfish have been stocked in connected Fountain Lake, where they are in higher abundance. Common Carp were sampled at a rate of 19.7 fish/gill net, which was near the average for Albert Lea Lake since 2005 (18.8 fish/gill net). Seventy percent of Common Carp sampled from both gear types measured between 8 and 12 inches. Other fish species sampled throughout the survey included Bigmouth Buffalo (N = 12), White Sucker (N = 20), Goldfish (N = 13), Green Sunfish (N = 17), Golden Shiner (N = 39), Common Shiner (N = 18), Orangespotted Sunfish (N = 12), River Carpsucker (N = 2), and Tadpole Madtom (N = 2). <br> 
 <br> 
Angling Summary <br> 
Walleye anglers at Albert Lea Lake should expect good fishing as the lake rebounds from the partial winterkill of 2014. The Walleye population consisted of mostly young fish (age-1 and 2) that are already measuring up to 16.5 inches. Walleye stocking will continue every other year and immediately after winterkills. Yellow Perch fishing also appears to have great potential in the near future as the young population continues to grow fast after the partial winterkill. <br> 
 <br> 
Anglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> 
 <br> 
Shoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2013-07-15',  County Name = 'Freeborn', Lake Name = 'Pickeral' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/15/2013 Clarity: 2.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Pickeral Lake is a shallow, 620 acre lake in Freeborn County.  Mean depth is 3.5 feet and maximum depth is 6 feet.  The city of Albert Lea is immediately northeast of Pickeral Lake.  A city-owned earthen public access is located on the southeast corner of the lake off highway 69.  The lake was reclaimed in fall of 2009 and experienced a partial winterkill during winter 2010-2011.  The shallow water column of Pickeral Lake makes it prone to frequent winterkill events.  Thus it is managed as a boom and bust northern pike and yellow perch fishery, where northern pike fry, pre-spawn yellow perch, and sometimes adult bluegills are stocked after reclamations or winterkill events.  These fish then exhibit rapid growth due to the abundance of forage coupled with lack of predation, creating a quality fishery within two or three years following the reclamation or winterkill event.   <br> 
 <br> 
Pickeral Lake was surveyed the week of July 15th, 2013 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by Minnesota DNR.  This survey consisted of deploying trap and gill nets to monitor the fish community.   The partial winterkill during 2010-2011 likely contributed to black bullhead being the most abundant fish sampled in the 2013 assessment.  Black bullhead averaged 282.0 fish/gill net, which is above average compared to similar lakes in Minnesota.  Average total length of black bullhead was 7.0 inches for both gear types, which was below an acceptable size to most anglers.  The second-most abundant species sampled in 2013 was bluegill, which averaged 46.0 fish/trap net and had a mean length of about 7.0 inches.  The abundances and weights of bluegill were both above what was considered a normal range for similar lakes in Minnesota.  The size and number of bluegills present in Pickeral Lake should provide quality opportunities for angling.  <br> 
 <br> 
Pickeral Lake features a high abundance of northern pike.  Northern pike averaged 14.5 fish/gill net, which was above average for this lake type.  Northern pike captured in gill nets ranged in total length from 15.0 to 33.0 inches, with the average total length of 24.0 inches.  The average pike weight was 3.7 pounds, which was above normal for similar lakes in Minnesota.  Most of the northern pike sampled during 2013 were from the 2010-2011 year classes.  <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch were also prevalent in the 2013 survey with a gill net catch rate of 63.0 fish/net.  The abundance of yellow perch during 2013 was well above average compared to similar Minnesota lakes.   Yellow perch ranged from 5.0 to 12.0 inches with the majority categorized as an acceptable size to most anglers.  Mean weight was 0.4 pounds, which is above average compared to similar lakes in Minnesota.   The yellow perch population looks to provide sufficient opportunity for anglers.   Black crappie, however, were observed in low numbers; mean length was 8.9 inches.  Other fish observed during the 2013 survey included green sunfish, and hybrid sunfish.       <br> 
 <br> 
Pickeral lake is shallow and hypereutrophic with sparse submergent vegetation.  It is one of many shallow satellite lakes around the city of Albert Lea and maintains an intermittent connection to the Shell Rock River just north of the lake.  Pickeral Lake's fish community is heavily influenced by this connection.  Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2015-07-06',  County Name = 'Freeborn', Lake Name = 'White' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/07/2015 Clarity: 3' 
 Narrative = '<p>White Lake, also known as Lake Chapeau, is a 168 acre lake located in Freeborn County near the town of Albert Lea. It has a maximum depth of 5 feet, with the entire surface area classified as littoral. Very little is known about the lake to this point and it has not been managed by DNR Fisheries due to a lack of public access. However, its connection to downstream lakes and as a potential Common Carp source makes it worth assessing as part of a larger watershed-scale management strategy. Rotenone reclamation was presented in 2010 as a tool to improve water quality and habitat but was met with opposition from public stakeholders. Previous data from White Lake were limited to a Special Assessment in 2010 using one gill net and 4 nonstandard trap nets. Regular dissolved oxygen monitoring has not taken place on White Lake, but winterkill events have likely occurred concurrently with other shallow lakes in the area. White Lake was surveyed the week of July 6, 2015 to establish a fisheries management plan with the hope that a public access will eventually be built on the lake. The fish community was assessed using one gill net and nine trap nets and water quality was recorded using secchi depth, dissolved oxygen, and temperature measurements. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch <br> 
A total of 13 Yellow Perch were sampled with the gill net for a catch rate of 13.0/net. This represents a drastic decline from the 2010 catch rate of 260/net. Lengths ranged from 7.1 to 8.3 inches with an average of 7.7 inches. Another 11 Yellow Perch ranging from 5.5 to 8.0 inches were sampled with trap nets. Fish from both gears were 1 or 2 years old, with 1 year old fish comprising over 91% of the sample. The drastic drop in catch rate from 2010 to 2015 and the young age of fish in the sample suggest that the population has experienced a significant mortality event in the recent past, most likely a winterkill in 2013-2014. <br> 
 <br> 
Black Bullhead <br> 
A total of 638 Black Bullheads ranging from 3.8 to 11.1 inches long were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 70.9/net. This represents an increase in abundance since the 2010 assessment that sampled 23.0/net, providing further proof that the lake most likely winterkilled between 2010 and 2015. An additional 10 Black Bullheads were sampled with the gill net. Given the shallow and winterkill-prone nature of White Lake, Black Bullheads are likely to remain a substantial member of a simple fish community. <br> 
 <br> 
Other Species <br> 
Other species sampled in 2015 include Fathead Minnow, Goldfish, Green Sunfish, and hybrid sunfish. Green Sunfish were the most commonly sampled fish, with 133 sampled with the gill net and over 94 sampled per trap net. A fish barrier now exists between White Lake and Fountain Lake, which coupled with a likely winterkill in 2013-2014, may explain the absence of species that were sampled in 2010 including Black Crappie, Common Carp, Largemouth Bass, and White Sucker. <br> 
 <br> 
Water Quality Parameters <br> 
Water quality parameter measurements included secchi depth, water temperature, and dissolved oxygen readings. At the time of this survey, secchi depth was 3 feet, indicating low water clarity. Water temperatures and dissolved oxygen readings throughout the water column ranged from 72.3 degrees Fahrenheit and 8.1 ppm at the surface to 71.8 degrees Fahrenheit and 7.8 ppm at 5 feet. Water quality in 2010 was described as being in a bright green and hypereutrophic state and aquatic plants were rarely observed. In 2015 however, the water was described as brown in color and aquatic plants, specifically Sago Pondweed and Chara, were noted as being commonly observed throughout the lake. This change can be attributed most likely to the absence of Common Carp due to a recent winterkill. <br> 
 <br> 
Anglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> 
 <br> 
Shoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br>

 Survey Date = '2011-08-15',  County Name = 'Grant', Lake Name = 'Barrett' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/15/2011 Clarity: 3.2' 
 Narrative = '<p>Barrett Lake is a 544-acre basin located on the Pomme de Terre River near the town of Barrett in Grant County. The lake is subject to excessive nutrient loading and sediment delivery from the river and its large, predominantly agricultural watershed.  Water quality is strongly influenced by river flow and climatic conditions.  Hot weather, calm winds, and low flow can trigger intense algae blooms.  Die-offs of curly-leaf pondweed can exacerbate these conditions.  Water clarity at time of the 2011 survey was 3.2 feet.  <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye catches during the 2011 survey were much higher than typical for similar lakes.  Gillnet catches averaged 26.8 fish/net.   The catch was generally comprised of 2- and 3-year-old fish from fry stocking and natural recruitment.   These 2- and 3-year old fish were approximately 12.0 and 16.0 inches in length.  Walleye grow fast in Barrett Lake.  Older fish captured during the survey averaged 18.8 inches at age 4.   There is also a high probability of catching large walleye.   Nearly 14% of captures in gillnets exceeded 20.0 inches.  Five memorable-size walleye exceeding 25.0 inches in total length were measured. <br> 
 <br> 
Barrett Lake supports a moderately abundant northern pike population.  Fishing quality is reasonably good fishery due to size distribution of the population.   Gillnet captures ranged from 16.0 to 35.0 inches in length.  Seventeen percent of captures exceeded 28.0 inches in total length.  These large pike likely migrate throughout the river during the spawning period.  <br> 
  <br> 
Both white and black crappie coexist in Barrett Lake.  Black crappie catches exceeded those of white crappie.  Some hybrid crappie also exist.  Abundance varies greatly due to inconsistent annual reproductive success and recruitment into the fishery.  Neither population could be described as abundant in 2011.   Even though crappie were not abundant, size distribution of the trapnet catch proved exceptional.    Forty-two percent of black crappie captured were 10.0 inches or larger.  Four captures exceeded 12.0 inches in total length.  One trophy-size crappie measuring 15.2 inches was recorded in the catch. <br> 
  <br> 
Seasonally poor water clarity and sparse aquatic vegetation limit abundance of largemouth bass and bluegill sunfish.  Lack of nursery and escape cover exposes young sunfish to predation and limits survival.   Only three largemouth bass were captured during the spring electrofishing survey.  The twelve bluegills caught in trapnets ranged from 3.0 to 7.7 inches.  Sunfishes can grow large, but until habitat conditions are more suitable, they are best described as a bonus catch. <br> 
 <br> 
The Department of Natural Resources installed an 84-foot handicapped accessible fishing pier on Barrett Lake near the City Park Pavilion. The park and fishing pier are maintained by the City of Barrett.  Anglers have reported catches of bluegill, crappie, and walleye from the pier. The Department of Natural Resources, Grant County and the City of Barrett also restructured the outlet of Barrett Lake. A fish ladder was constructed by strategically placing boulders to create slack water areas. Fish are now free to migrate into Barrett Lake from downstream waters. <br>

 Survey Date = '2008-06-16',  County Name = 'Grant', Lake Name = 'Lightning' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/16/2008 Clarity: 2.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Lightning Lake is a 500-acre basin located on the upper reach of the Mustinka River in northwest Grant County.  Turbidity is often high and dense algae blooms are common during summer months.  Water quality and gamefish habitat is poor.  Maximum depth of this shallow basin is just 11.0 feet, which makes it prone to occasional winterkill.  The last winterkill event occurred during the winter of 2007-2008.  Consequently,  fish community diversity and fishing opportunities are limited.  Similar to many shallow lakes in western Minnesota, the walleye fishery is often "boom or bust" depending on presence of strong year classes and frequency and severity of winterkill events.  Walleye fry are stocked on an alternate year basis and strong year classes usually correspond to a successful fry stocking.  Most of the total annual fishing pressure occurs early in the season, prior to onset of algae blooms.    <br> 
 <br> 
2008 survey results revealed the impact of the 2007-2008 winterkill event.  With exception of northern pike, other gamefish catches were limited.  Pike abundance was considered moderate.  Larger pike were present but most were small- to medium-sized individuals.  Mean size was 21.3 inches and 2.2 pounds.  Other game fish collected were black crappie, walleye, and yellow perch.  Catch rates of these species were extremely low.  Non-game fishes tolerant of low dissolved oxygen levels comprised the most of the total capture sample.  The next lake survey is scheduled for 2012.  <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2010-08-23',  County Name = 'Grant', Lake Name = 'Lower Elk' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/23/2010 Clarity: 3' 
 Narrative = '<p>Lower Elk Lake is a small, fertile lake located just north of Hoffman in eastern Grant County.  This lake is not highly developed and recreational pressure is minimal.  Maximum depth is less than 15.0 ft, thus the fish community is vulnerable to periodic winterkill events.  Water clarity is seasonally poor.  Summer water clarity measurements rarely exceed 3.0 feet.  Dense algal blooms are common throughout summer months.  Submergent vegetation is limited and is usually found in extremely shallow areas adjacent to the shoreline. <br> 
 <br> 
Because the lake is susceptible to periodic winterkill, fisheries management efforts have been limited.  Walleye fry are stocked on an alternate year basis to maintain a modest walleye fishery.  Low density populations of bluegill, largemouth bass, and northern pike are present.  These fish grow very fast so there are modest, quality angling opportunities.  More than half of 2010 bluegill captures exceeded 8.0 inches in length.  Average size of sampled largemouth bass was 17.4 inches.  Yellow perch are abundant, but at time of the survey captures were young fish.  Mean length of captures was 7.0 inches.  In sustained absence of winterkill, a fair perch fishery should develop in a couple of years. <br>

 Survey Date = '2008-06-09',  County Name = 'Grant', Lake Name = 'Mustinka River Flowage' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/09/2008 Clarity: 1.1' 
 Narrative = '<p>Mustinka Lake is located four miles north of Herman in Grant County.  The lake is a small man-made impoundment of the Mustinka River. The dam was constructed in the late 30's.  Sediment deposition has reduced maximum depth of the reservoir from approximately 18 feet to 8 feet.  Dense algal blooms and suspended sediment limit water clarity. Secchi disk measurements generally do not exceed 2.0 feet.  Rooted aquatic plants are limited by poor water clarity and thus sunfish densities are low.  Mustinka Lake is prone to occasional winterkill.  A county owned park (Pine Ridge Park) and public launch are located on the northwest side of the lake. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike are abundant.  Mean weight was 2.2 lbs.  Northern pike as large as 29.0 inches were captured. Walleye are stocked and present in  moderate density.Most captured walleye were 12.0 to 14.0 inches in length at the time of the survey. <br> 
 <br> 
Lake Mustinka currently supports a tremendous number of black crappie. Trap net catches exceeded 20.0 fish per net. Average size was small due to the young fish making up the population.  No black crappie exceeded 9.5 inches in length.  <br> 
 <br> 
Other species sampled during the survey were black bullhead, common carp, bluegill, largemouth bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead and yellow perch.  <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2013-06-17',  County Name = 'Grant', Lake Name = 'Pelican' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/17/2013 Clarity: 2.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Pelican Lake is a 3,760-acre eutrophic (nutrient rich) system located southeast of Ashby in Grant County.  Pelican Lake has a maximum depth of 21.0 feet and average depth of 10.0 feet.  Water quality is seasonally poor due to nutrient enrichment and internal recycling of nutrients in bottom sediments during periods of strong winds.  Water clarity during summer months (2009  2012) averaged only 2.7 feet due to frequent algae blooms and sediment re-suspension.  Despite periods of poor water transparency, aquatic plants are abundant and are found in depths up to 8.0 feet.  Game fish habitat conditions are not ideal, but due to the lake's high fertility and shoreline irregularity it is highly productive and supports very good fishing. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleyes are abundant due to natural reproduction and biennial fry stocking efforts.  Gillnet catches during the June 2013 survey averaged 10.5 walleye/net.  The catch was comprised of cohorts from 13 age classes.  Due to the broad age structure, lengths at capture varied from 8.1 to 24.3 inches.  Average size was 15.3 inches or 1.4 pounds. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike catches were also above average compared to similar lakes in Minnesota.  Average size of pike was 23.5 inches and 2.8 pounds.  Several captures exceeded 30.0 inches.   <br> 
 <br> 
Members of the sunfish family do surprisingly well in Pelican Lake.  Largemouth bass and bluegill sunfish are abundant.  Bluegill catch rates in 2013 exceeded expectations.  High abundance estimates are likely related to the establishment of a very strong year class in 2010.  These three-year-old fish made up 62% of the total catch in trapnets.  Lengths at capture varied from 3.2 to 10.0 inches. Approximately 7% of collected bluegills exceeded 8.0 inches.  The largemouth bass population supports excellent fishing.  Age distribution of the bass catch extended to age 15.  Average length of bass caught was fairly small (9.6 inches).  Low average size is likely due to the high proportion of young fish recruiting into the population.  Despite a low average size, several large individuals (> 18.0 inches) were collected.  Seventeen percent of bass caught were larger than 15.0 inches.  Both black and white crappies co-exist in Pelican Lake.  Black crappies are abundant and greatly outnumber white crappies.  Much of the catch was comprised of young fish (age 4 or less).  Black crappies collected in trapnets averaged 7.8 inches in length, but the maximum size caught was 13.9 inches.  A high abundance of young crappies in Pelican Lake will afford good fishing in upcoming years.   <br> 
 <br> 
Predator densities may be too great for optimal growth and sustainable yields.  Numbers of yellow perch large enough to capture in gillnets has declined dramatically over past decades.  None were large enough to harvest.  Only 16 perch were caught.  These captures averaged 5.9 inches in length.  Due to excessive predation, perch are maturing earlier and channeling energy into reproduction rather than body growth.  Pelican Lake's bass, walleye, and pike are hungry and should be easier to catch. <br> 
 <br> 
One point of public access is available in Pelican Lake.  Public access consists of a concrete boat launch on the western shore (UTM coordinates [zone: 15]; 281117E, 5104789N).  <br> 
 <br> 
Pelican Lake is scheduled to be surveyed every four years.  Upcoming surveys are scheduled for 2017 and 2021. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2011-08-22',  County Name = 'Grant', Lake Name = 'Pomme de Terre' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/22/2011 Clarity: 2.6' 
 Narrative = '<p>Pomme de Terre Lake is a shallow, 1758-acre basin located on the Pomme de Terre River in Grant County.   The river transports significant amounts of nutrients and sediment to and through the lake.  Water quality and clarity can be poor following heavy rainfall events and during the heat of the summer due to suspended sediments and algae blooms.   Water clarity at the start of the 2011 fish community assessment was 2.6 feet.  Due to seasonally poor water quality and water level fluctuations, the lake does not support many aquatic plants.  <br> 
  <br> 
Pomme de Terre Lake is managed as a walleye fishery.  Walleye fry are stocked during odd-numbered years to supplement natural reproduction and sustain population abundance objectives.   Walleye catches during the 2011 survey averaged 7.3 fish/gillnet which is average for similar lakes.  Relatively few old walleye were captured suggesting annual mortality is high.  Fortunately, walleye grow exceptionally fast in Pomme de Terre Lake and quickly reach a harvestable size.  Age-3 walleye averaged 16.0 inches in length.  Size structure of the population sample proved excellent.  Seventy-seven percent of walleye captures exceeded 15.0 inches.  Due to fast growth, 19% of the population sample was comprised of 20.0-inch and larger walleye.  <br> 
 <br> 
Both black and white crappie were netted during the 2011 fish community assessment.  Black crappie catches exceeded that of white crappie, but neither of these populations was abundant at time of the survey.  Population density varies from year to year in response to inconsistent spawning success or survival of young fish.   While not abundant in 2011, crappie grow fast and can get large.  The largest black crappie measured during the 2011 survey was 13.4 inches in length.  <br> 
  <br> 
Seasonally poor water quality, limited vegetation, and water level instability constitute a harsh environment for sight feeding predators, nesting species, and young gamefishes dependent upon aquatic plants for feeding and escape cover.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and yellow perch are able to sustain their presence, but these species have seldom been described as abundant.   Most bluegill and yellow perch were too small at time of the survey to contribute much to the fishery.  Northern pike and largemouth bass catch success may be low, but these popular gamefish can provide good fishing because of their large average size.  Average weight of northern pike captures was 3.1 lbs.  Seventy-three percent of largemouth bass caught during the survey were 15.0 inches and larger.   <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2015-07-27',  County Name = 'Grant', Lake Name = 'Thompson' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/27/2015 Clarity: 7' 
 Narrative = '<p>Thompson Lake is a 150-acre basin located five miles north of Hoffman in Grant County.  It is a relatively shallow, turbid, and excessively fertile lake that is prone to occasional fish kills.  Diversity and abundance of rooted aquatic plants are limited.  Aquatic vegetation provides critical habitat for many fish species. Strong winds and wave actions can result in re-suspension of fine silts and attached nutrients, stimulating frequent algal blooms.  Water clarity and recreational uses can be seasonally impaired.   <br> 
 <br> 
Catch statistics from the 2015 survey suggest possible occurrence of a partial fish kill event in advance of the survey.  This is most evident in Walleye, Bluegill, and Black Crappie catch data.  Walleye fingerlings and yearlings have been stocked in odd-numbered years since 2003.  Walleye catches were elevated during the 2015 survey with a catch rate of 12.0-fish/gill net.  A few larger Walleye were present but the catch was largely comprised of juvenile fish no older than age two.  These young fish were likely products of fingerling and yearling stockings in 2013 and early 2015.  Bluegill catches declined from 12.0-fish/trap net in 2009 to 2.9-fish/trap net in 2015.  Black crappie catches were also low in 2015.  All Bluegill and Black Crappie catches were comprised of young fish.  However, these young fish grow rapidly in this fertile basin.  In 2015, average size was 6.9 inches for Bluegill and 8.4 inches for Black Crappie.  The largest Bluegill measured was 9.8 inches.  The largest Black Crappie measured 10.9 inches.  Thompson Lake currently supports an excellent Largemouth Bass fishery.  Spring 2015 electrofishing results indicated record-high bass abundance and exceptional size structure.  Almost 25% of the electrofishing sample exceeded 15.0 inches and the largest bass collected measured 19.9 inches.  The Yellow Perch population also exhibited a favorable size structure.  Good numbers of 8.0- and 9.0-inch perch were collected with the largest perch measuring 11.0 inches.  This population provides a unique angling opportunity because high-quality Yellow Perch populations are not common in the Glenwood Management Area.  No northern pike have been captured since 1999.  Limited aquatic vegetation and high water temperatures during summer months likely explain the absence of this cool water species.   <br> 
 <br> 
Other species sampled in low numbers include Common Carp, Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish and White Sucker. <br>

 Survey Date = '2013-06-10',  County Name = 'Hennepin', Lake Name = 'Hyland' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/18/2013 Clarity: 9' 
 Narrative = '<p>Hyland is a shallow, productive 84-acre lake located in Bloomington, in Hennepin County.  The entire lake is within the Hyland Lake Park Reserve, operated by Three Rivers Park District.  There is a fishing pier and boat launch (a fee exists for boat trailer parking), though gas-motorized boats are not allowed to operate on the lake. There are also multiple locations to fish from shore.  <br> 
 <br> 
Water quality in Hyland Lake has improved over the years, in part because of Three Rivers Park District's efforts to control curly-leaf pondweed.  Since 2011, declines in total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a have been documented.  Additionally, Secchi disk measurements indicate water clarity has increased over the past few years.  However, the lake's shallow, fertile characteristics still make it prone to occasional small-scale fish die-offs related to thermal or oxygen stress.   <br> 
  <br> 
This lake is primarily managed for Largemouth Bass and Bluegill, yet it also contains some Black Crappie and Walleye.  Past management has included: hybrid (tiger) Muskellunge stocking from 1988-1999 and a Largemouth Bass no-harvest slot of 12-16 inches from 1981-1993.  Because of the lake's thermal and oxygen limitations (which included a partial winterkill in 1989-90), these efforts did not establish viable Muskellunge populations or better-quality Largemouth Bass fishing.  A standard population assessment consisting of gill nets and trap nets was conducted in 2013 to characterize the game fish community.   <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill was the most abundant species in the assessment.  At 35.5 per trap net, abundance was high and ranked near the 75th percentile value compared with other similar lakes.  Hyland Lake has had consistently abundant Bluegill populations, but with variable size structures.  In 2013, the size structure was weighted toward larger fish, where 42% were between 7.0 and 7.5 inches.  Bluegill ranged from 3.4-8.1 inches, averaging 6.7 inches and weighing 0.2 lbs.  Bluegill in Hyland Lake are long-lived; 26% were older than 10 years and the oldest was age 15.  Growth was similar to the statewide average, where Bluegill were 6.9 inches by age 5.  <br> 
 <br> 
Black Crappie were low in trap-net abundance (0.63/net) and moderately low in gill-net abundance (3.3/net).  Crappie ranged from 4.0 to 9.4 inches, averaging 5.7 inches and 0.2 lbs.  Historically, Black Crappie abundances have been moderately low in Hyland Lake.  Over the previous 5 assessments, crappie catch has ranged from 1.0 to 5.5 per gill net, averaging 3.7/net.  Given the small sample size of Black Crappie in this assessment, ages were only determined for a few fish.  Similar to Bluegill, several crappie were long-lived.  Two reached age 12; however the larger of these two was only 8.8 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Since 2004, Hyland Lake has regularly been stocked with Walleye fingerlings and/or yearlings on even-numbered years.  Despite this, Walleye abundance is low.  In the previous assessment (2008), 5 Walleye (1.3 per gill net) were sampled.  In the 2013 assessment, 11 Walleye (2.8 per gill net) were sampled.  In this most current 2013 assessment, all Walleye were exclusively from the two most recent stockings:  fingerlings in 2010 (age 3 fish) and yearlings in 2012 (age 2).  These represented 75% and 25% of the total, respectively.  No fish stocked in 2004, 2006, or 2008 were sampled.  Walleye ranged from 10.7 to 16.3 inches, averaging 13.8 inches.  Mean weight was 0.8 lbs, moderately low when compared to other similar lakes. <br> 
 <br> 
No Northern Pike were sampled in the 2013 assessment.  Other fishes sampled in low abundance were Black Bullhead, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, White Sucker, Yellow Perch, and Largemouth Bass.  Passive sampling gear, such as the trap and gill nets used here, are not effective methods for collecting Largemouth Bass, so the 2013 assessment values likely under-represents bass abundance.  Electrofishing is the typical method for  <br> 
Largemouth Bass assessments but was not conducted.      <br> 
 <br> 
Beginning in the winter of 2012-13, Three Rivers Park District has a permit to pump water from Hyland Lake for snow-making operations.  This could affect water levels and ice thicknesses.  Be aware and heed any signs and information related to Hyland Lake winter access/travel. <br>

 Narrative = '<p>Long is a productive, 285-acre lake located in the City of Long Lake in Hennepin County.  There is a city-owned public boat access and beach on the west shore of the lake.  Maximum depth is 33 ft and water clarity in early July was 2.2 ft.  At that time in early July, a temperature-oxygen profile indicated the lake was strongly stratified with poor (<2 ppm) dissolved oxygen below 10 feet.   A population assessment consisting of summer gill nets and fall trap nets was conducted in 2013 to characterize the game fish community.   <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye stocking in Long Lake began in 1989 when fry were introduced.  Fry stocking maintained a modest Walleye fishery from then through the 1990's.  In 2001, a switch was made to larger fall-stocked fingerling Walleye.  Varying fingerlings rates and one fry stocking took place in 2003, 2005, and 2007, when the lake was part of a MN DNR Fisheries Research study. The current management plan (effective 2009) calls for 262 lbs of Walleye fingerlings to be stocked in odd-numbered years.     <br> 
 <br> 
Summer gill nets sampled 20 Walleye-3.3/net.  Relative abundance was nearly average (2.8/net) compared to similar lakes statewide.  Walleye size structure was balanced, consisting of two distinct size groups of sub-20-inch fish, either 11-13 inches (55 percent of total) or 18-20 inches (45 percent of total).  These groups corresponded to the stocked 2011 (age 2) and 2009 (age 4) year classes, with one fish from the 2007 year class (age 6).  Walleye averaged 14.6 inches and 1.2 lbs. <br> 
 <br> 
Forty Walleye were sampled in fall trap nets- 4.4/net.  Sampled-fish sizes were 13.2-21.6 inches and averaged 15.5 inches and 1.3 lbs.  Size structure didn't appear as balanced as the gill nets, likely because 70 percent of the fish were between 13 and 15 inches.  Five fish over 20 inches were sampled as well.  These larger fish were not observed in the gill nets.  Growth of Walleye was slightly slower than the average compared to other similar lakes in the West Metro Management Area.  Walleye averaged 15.1 inches by age 4.  <br> 
 <br> 
Long Lake is eutrophic, and, at times, portions of the water column may suffer from lack of oxygen.  High summer water temperature and subsequent low dissolved oxygen may push the limits for optimal growth and survival of Walleye.   <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike were moderately abundant.  At 4.0/gill net, catch was near average (3.8/net) when compared to other similar lakes.  Pike abundance was higher than that of the previous assessment (1.7/net in 2008), but lower than the mean (5.7/net) over the past 4 assessments dating back to 2001.  The size structure was skewed toward larger individuals.  Sixty-three percent of the Northern Pike were relatively evenly distributed between 26.0 and 31.0 inches.  They ranged from 21.0 - 35.4 inches, averaging 27.6 inches and 4.9 lbs.  The weight of an average pike was heavier than the 75th percentile value (3.5 lbs) when compared to other similar lakes.  Ages ranged from 3 to 7.  Pike grew faster than other lakes in the West Metro Area, reaching 27.6 inches by age 5.       <br> 
 <br> 
Abundance of Bluegill in fall trap nets was moderately high (45.4/net), with size structure skewed toward larger fish.  Forty-two percent were between 7.0 and 7.5 inches.  Bluegill ranged from 3.1 - 8.0 inches, averaging 6.2 inches and 0.2 lbs.  Bluegill mean weight was moderately high when compared to other similar lakes.  Catch rates have varied over the previous 4 assessments; however, mean weight has remained relatively high (mean = 0.25 lb).  Age of Bluegill in the sample ranged from 1 to 5.  Growth was fast compared to other similar lakes.  Bluegill were 7.0 inches by age 3.  <br> 
 <br> 
Black Crappie were abundant (16.7/gill net) but size structure was small.  Gillnet catch was the highest observed in the previous 4 assessments dating to 2001.  Catch during these assessments averaged 6.7/net.  In the 2013 assessment, lengths ranged from 4.1 - 8.5 inches, with 45 percent between 7.5 and 8.5 inches.  Crappie averaged 6.5 inches and 0.2 lbs.  Growth was fast compared to other similar, as fish averaged 8.1 inches by age 3.  Fall trap nets collected fewer Black Crappie, but the size structure was larger.  Forty-six crappie were sampled in the trap nets (5.1/net); of these, 85 percent were between 8.5 and 9.5 inches. These fall-sampled fish ranged from 5.6 to 9.5 inches and averaged 8.4 inches.   <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch abundance (13.2/gill net) was typical of lakes of this type.  From 2001-2008, (past 4 assessments), relative abundance has ranged from 1.8-24.8/net, averaging 10.0/net.   In 2013, all perch sampled were between 5.8 and 7.7 inches.  The average fish was 6.6 inches and 0.1 lbs.  All Yellow Perch were from the 2010 year class (age 3).  Growth was fast compared to other similar lakes.         <br> 
 <br> 
Other species sampled during the assessment were Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, Largemouth Bass, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.  Passive sampling gear, such as trap and gill nets, are not effective methods for collecting Largemouth Bass, so the numbers from the 2013 assessment are not necessarily representative of the entire population.  Electrofishing is the typical method for Largemouth Bass assessments but was not conducted.   <br> 
 <br> 
A fish kill on this lake, reported by several people, occurred on or near August 14, 2011.  Given the description, timing, lake conditions, and a similar occurrence at another local lake, the small-scale die-off of mostly Black Crappie and Bluegill appeared to stem from thermal stress-a combination of low oxygen and increased bacterial levels when fishes' physiological demands run high.  No broad, long-lasting depletion of the overall fish community was apparent from this assessment's results, though it could reflect conditions where coolwater fish species might not thrive.  <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2016-06-13',  County Name = 'Hennepin', Lake Name = 'Minnetonka' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/18/2016 Clarity: 3' 
 Narrative = '<p>Introduction <br> 
The 2016 Lake Minnetonka (27-0133-00) Standard Survey (new term effective 2015; gears and methods same as previous terms of Population Assessment and Lake Survey) was conducted June 13 through June 29.  Annual fish sampling began in 1997 following a 20-year period of sampling once every five years.  Annual sampling continued through 2012; however the frequency of sampling changed after that survey.  The current management plan now requires surveys on even-numbered years (biennially). <br> 
 <br> 
This survey describes trends in growth, condition, relative abundance, reproduction, and size structure of three native sportfish species having long timelines of sample data: Walleye, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch.  Sampling these species involved 24 experimental gill-net sets at 12 historic locations (24-hr sets; 2 net sets at each location with approximately 7-9 days between net sets.  Springtime night electrofishing was also conducted this survey, to evaluate Largemouth Bass.  Eleven electrofishing stations were sampled over four nights. In 2016, trap netting was also included in the survey, providing information on Bluegill relative abundance and size structure.  Sampling in Lake Minnetonka is divided into three aggregations of basins that differ in their habitat and water chemistry characteristics.  Data is analyzed as an entire lake and by basin.  Overall, the 2016 gill-net assessment revealed a diverse fish community (18 species) dominated by Northern Pike (36.5 lb/net), Bluegill (5.2 lb/net), and Walleye (8.0 lb/net). <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
Water Characteristics <br> 
Water clarity, as indicated by Secchi-depth values, has been improving in Lake Minnetonka over the past several decades.  The Northwest Bays are most fertile, primarily because they are the first recipients of the majority of surface runoff from the watershed.  The Upper Lakes are intermediate in fertility, while the Lower Lakes are, relatively, the least fertile.  Increasing water clarity can be attributed to improvements in the condition of the watershed.  Increased water clarity was observed before the 2010 discovery of zebra mussels.  The Minnehaha Creek Watershed District more closely monitors water quality in Lake Minnetonka.  For more a more specific, detailed information of Lake Minnetonka water quality, see the District's website (http://www.minnehahacreek.org/data-center).    <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye <br> 
Lake Minnetonka management, as of this report write-up, includes stocking 6,446 pounds of fingerling Walleye in even-numbered years (approx. 96,000-128,000 fish).  This equates to 1.1 lb/littoral acre.  Starting in the fall of 2010, Walleye were and will continue to be stocked into all three basins of the lake.  For more than 30 years prior to 2010, previous management limited Walleye stocking locations to the Upper Lake and Lower Lake basins.  Since 2004, most or all of the Walleye fingerlings stocked were purchased from Minnesota-based fish vendors under State contracts. <br> 
 <br> 
In 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 the Westonka Walleye Program (WWP), a privately-funded organization, received permits to stock Walleye in the Northwest Bays of the lake.  Fundraising events are underway to purchase Walleye for 2017 as well.  The goal of the WWP is to stock larger fish that will have higher initial survival.  The permits allow stocking of even-numbered year-classes that coincide with DNR stocking (so any natural reproduction can be better tracked).  In the fall of 2013, the WWP stocked 2,502 yearling Walleye (6/lb).  In 2014, they stocked 10,500 fingerling Walleye (8-13" TL, 7/lb).  In 2015, WWP stocked 12,964 yearling Walleye (7fish/lb) and in 2016, they stocked 32,000 fingerling Walleye (7.6/lb).  Future assessments will look closely to ascertain changes in Walleye abundances and sizes resulting from these stockings.  <br> 
 <br> 
Despite extensive recent stockings, Walleye abundance, as indexed by gill-net catch-per-unit-effort, has remained at a low density.  Since 1977, 22 fisheries assessments have been conducted on Lake Minnetonka; of these, 14 had Walleye catch rates below the first quartile (4.0 fish/net) of Class 22 lakes.  Catch rates during this time ranged from 1.5-8.8/net, averaging 4.0/net (median = 3.6/net).  In 2016, Walleye abundance (3.3/net) was higher than the 2.6/net caught in 2014.   Slightly higher catch rates were observed in the Northwest Bays and the Uppers Lakes.  Walleye catch rate dropped in the Lower Lakes, from 3.6/net in 2014, to 3.0/net in 2016.  In Upper Lakes, Walleye catch increased from 2.4 to 3.1/net.  In the Northwest Bays, catch increased from 1.2 to 3.8 Walleye/net.  The long-term (1997-2016) average Walleye gill-net catch per net for Upper Lakes is 4.0 (median=3.5), 4.7 (median = 4.3) in Lower Lakes, and 3.4 (median=3.5) in the Northwest Bays.  <br> 
 <br> 
The numerical Walleye population estimate, calculated from gillnet catch and fish-age data, was 27,008 fish.  Since 1992, the Lake Minnetonka Walleye population estimate range has been 12,465 (in 2005)-72,715 fish. <br> 
 <br> 
Historically, size structure indices have shown Lake Minnetonka's Walleye population consists of larger individuals; this was again observed in 2016. Walleye averaged 18.3 inches in length and ranged from 8.1-27.8 inches.  Average length was lower in the Northwest Bays (17.4 inches) and in the Lower Lakes (17.6 inches) and higher in the Upper Lakes (19.4 inches). Walleye mean weight in 2016 (2.5 lb) exceeded the third Lake Class quartile (75th percentile) when compared to other Class 22 lakes, and this has been the case since the 1992 assessment.  Mean weight was highest in the Upper Lakes (3.0 lb), followed by the Lower Lakes (2.3 lb), and the Northwest Bays (2.1 lb).  The general trend had once been for the greatest proportion of larger Walleyes to be located in the Northwest Bays.  That changed in the 2016 survey, suggesting an influence of the Westonka Walleye stocking on the size structure of the fish in the Northwest Bays.  Growth of Walleye sampled in 2016 was a little faster than in previous assessments.  In general, Walleye grew to 13.6 inches by age-3 and 20.6 inches by age-6. <br> 
 <br> 
Aging Walleyes using otoliths allowed year-class inferences to be made. Consistent with previous assessments, Walleye natural reproduction is limited.  In 2016, 2 of 78 (3 percent) Walleye originated from a non-stocked year-class.  In recent assessments, few younger Walleye have been sampled in non-stocked year classes.  Age-4 Walleye (stocked 2012 year class) were the most abundant in the 2016 sample (37 percent of the total).  These fish averaged 17.9 inches.  The 2010 year-class was the second most abundant comprising 31 percent of the total catch.  Those 6-year-old fish averaged 20.6 inches.   <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike <br> 
From 2002 to 2011, gillnet catch of Northern Pike had decreased every year, from a high of 17.7/net to a low of 6.3/net.  However, recent surveys (2012, 2014, and 2016) show an increasing trend to values greater than 10/net.  The 2016 catch (13.8/net) is high (above 75th percentile) compared to other Class 22 lakes in the state and is higher than the long-term average of 10.8/net (1977-2016).  Northern Pike catch rates in the Lower Lakes (16.0 fish/net) exceeded catch in both the Upper Lakes (15.7 fish/net) and Northwest Bays (5.8 fish/net).  	 <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
In 2016, Northern Pike average size (2.65 lb) was similar to that found in 2014 (2.73 lb).  Mean weight was near the 75th percentile for Class 22 lakes.  In the current survey, these fish averaged 21.8 inches in length, which was comparable to 22.4 inches in 2014.  Northern Pike mean length was greatest in the Northwest Bays (25.9 inches) followed by  Upper Lakes (22.3 inches) then Lower Lakes (20.4 inches).  The largest individual captured was an age-7 female at 34.7 inches.  Forty-three percent were 21 inches or longer and 15 percent were 28 inches or longer.  The largest size structure was found in the Northwest Bays, where 83 percent were 21 inches or longer and 39 percent were 28 inches or longer. <br> 
 <br> 
Growth rates were similar to other West Metro Management Area lakes.  On average, Northern Pike in Lake Minnetonka were 20.1 inches by age-3 and 27.8 inches by age-6.  Nine year-classes were sampled and most fish (89 percent) were between 2 and 6 years old. <br> 
 <br> 
This survey was the first since a wintertime spearing ban (enacted winter 1987-88) was rescinded in December 2015.  The 2015-16 winter was mild, with thinner ice, so impacts of re-opening winter Northern Pike spearing were likely less than expected and/or delayed.  Future surveys could show influences of this regulation change on the species' abundances and size structures. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch <br> 
Yellow Perch abundance (11.1/net) in 2016 was moderately low compared to other Class 22 lakes.  The Northwest Bays have historically had the highest Yellow Perch abundance and this was again true in 2016.  Abundance in the Northwest Bays was 31.2/gill net, 7.4/net in the Upper Lakes, and 2.0/net in the Lower Lakes.   <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch size structure has been historically small in Lake Minnetonka.  In 2016, size structure indices revealed a population consisting of small individuals that ranged in size from 4.9 - 8.6 inches; only 3.3 percent were greater than 8 inches.  Mean length (6.5 inches) and weight (0.12 lb) were similar to 2014 values.   <br> 
 <br> 
Seven year-classes were sampled with the oldest individual captured age-10.  Seventy-two percent were age-2 or 3.  Yellow Perch growth was similar to other Class 22 lakes in the West Metro Management Area.  Growth was consistent among basins; fish reached an average of 6.8 inches by age 3.   <br> 
 <br> 
Muskellunge <br> 
Muskellunge were not targeted during this survey, and onlytwo individuals were sampled. One fish, measuring 14.9 inches, like originated from the 2015 stocking.  The second individual measured 48.4 inches and weighed 29.61 pounds.  Based on angler reports, Minnetonka's Muskellunge population remains strong.   Fish exceeding 50 inches and approaching 40 pounds are caught in Lake Minnetonka every year.  Survival of stocked fingerling Muskellunge is assumed to be low due to the high abundance of Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike.  Advanced fingerlings and yearlings have been used in recent years in an attempt to improve survival rates of stocked fish.  <br> 
 <br> 
A research study is currently taking place in Lake Minnetonka comparing the survival of stocked fingerling and yearling Muskellunge.  Stocked fish were tagged in 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2012.  Muskellunge were tagged with an external spaghetti-type tag near the dorsal fin on the fish's left side.  These tags, yellow in color, include a six-digit number.  For longer-term tracking, an internal PIT-style tag was also inserted and can only be detected with a specific reader.  Angler reports of captured tagged Muskellunge are essential to the success of this project.  If you catch a tagged Muskellunge please record the tag number and length of fish and report the catch via the Tagged Fish Reporting page within the MNDNR website.  Please DO NOT remove the tag.  Please contact the West Metro Area Fisheries Office with questions.  Practicing CPR (Catch, Photo, and Release) is essential to maintaining the trophy Muskellunge fishery found in Lake Minnetonka.   <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth Bass <br> 
The Largemouth Bass population in Lake Minnetonka has a reputation for quality fishing.  In May 2016, a nighttime boat electrofishing assessment was performed to target Largemouth Bass.  A total of 138 Largemouth Bass were sampled in 11 electrofishing transects, equating to 49.9 bass per hour of on-time.  The size structure of the Largemouth Bass population in Lake Minnetonka is well-balanced and the fish are in good physical condition.  Largemouth Bass averaged 9.9 inches and 0.65 lb, lower than in 2014 when fish averaged 11.8 inches and 1.04 lb.  The largest bass sampled was 18.7 inches long and 3.7 lb.  Fish from the 2004 through 2015 year classes were present, indicating consistent reproduction and recruitment.  Age-2 bass from the 2014 year class were most abundant (24 percent), followed by the 2013 (21 percent of the total) and 2012 (14 percent of the total) year classes.  Largemouth Bass reached 14 inches by age 8 and 18 inches by age 11.  No Smallmouth Bass were sampled during the spring electrofishing assessment.    <br> 
 <br> 
Numerous bass tournaments are held on the lake every year.  Larger tournaments require DNR permits that include submission of some fish-related data.  In 2016, 11 permitted bass tournaments reported totals of 1,058 tournament anglers, 3,947 Largemouth Bass and 197 Smallmouth Bass during these events. The number of Smallmouth Bass reported in 2016 was quite large compared to previous years.  Average Largemouth Bass size was 2.34 lb and the largest recorded was 6.69 lb.  Since tournament bass anglers target the largest individuals, and tournaments usually apply minimum size requirements, results typically show larger size fish, on average, than electrofishing sampling, where all Largemouth Bass sampled are used for analyses.  <br> 
  <br> 
Bluegill and Other Fish Species <br> 
Bluegill and Black Crappie are abundant in Lake Minnetonka and thus are not of enhanced management focus.  Bluegill were sampled by trap netting in 2016, as part of a statewide study of the ecological impacts of Muskellunge stocking.  The fish were caught at a rate of 72.9 fish per trap net, which is very high for this type of lake.  Bluegill averaged 5.9 inches and 0.17 pounds; the largest individual was 8.3 inches.  Caught at a rate of 7.4 per gill net, Black Crappie are highly abundant and modestly sized.  Black Crappie averaged 6.8 inches and 0.17 pounds, with the largest individual measuring 10.4 inches. Consistent natural reproduction and high recruitment of these species have ensured quality angling opportunities.   <br> 
 <br> 
Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, Green Sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Yellow Bullhead, Common Carp, Golden Shiner, and Bowfin were also captured in low numbers during the 2016 assessment. Smallmouth Bass were sampled only in the Lower Lakes. <br> 
 <br> 
Invasive Aquatic Species <br> 
Eurasian watermilfoil and curlyleaf pondweed are found in high abundance throughout the lake and in 2010 zebra mussels and flowering rush were first found to be present.  Lake Minnetonka receives heavy recreational use, so potential for the spread of invasive species into and out of the lake is high.  Anglers and boaters should take the precautions-and follow statewide laws- to prevent the further spread of all invasive species.  <br> 
 <br> 
The shoreline and watershed of Lake Minnetonka is highly developed, which puts stress on the lake's aquatic habitat and ecosystem integrity.  Large docks, boating platforms, and man-made beaches have the potential to destroy vital habitat for fish and wildlife.  Environmentally conscious land use practices, such as shoreline buffer strips of natural vegetation and fallen woody debris, are necessary to maintain or improve water quality of Lake Minnetonka.  Shoreline development, invasive species, fish disease potential (such as Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia [VHS] and Largemouth Bass Virus) should be a concern to everyone who enjoys lake recreation. <br>

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/29/2011 Clarity: 16.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Beauty Lake is a small, 55 acre lake with a maximum depth of 53.0 feet located 19 miles north of Park Rapids in Hubbard County.  There is a county-owned public boat access located on the southeast shore of the lake.  The first fisheries survey of Beauty Lake was conducted in 2001, so historical information about the fish populations is limited.  Water quality analysis showed Beauty Lake to be a very infertile body of water (total alkalinity of 39 ppm).The water quality characteristics of Beauty are due to its small watershed and location in lightly developed pine and mixed hardwood forest.  The productivity of a small lake like Beauty is very limited making the fish population very sensitive to over harvest from fishing.  It is very important that anglers practice selective harvest when fishing Beauty Lake.  Selective harvest allows for the limited harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium to large-size fish.  Releasing these fish will help maintain the fish population in Beauty Lake and provide anglers with opportunities to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Beauty Lake provides angling opportunities for northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish. <br> 
 <br> 
The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Beauty Lake is in lake class 20.  Other area lakes in this same classification include Blacksmith and Crappie. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike abundance was high (17.0 pike/gillnet), similar to the previous survey in 2001.  The northern pike sample was dominated by small, "hammer handle" pike, with an average length and weight of 19.1 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Northern pike up to 31.5 inches were sampled.  Good numbers of largemouth bass were sampled with standard survey gear.  As far as the panfish species, pumpkinseed seem to be of an acceptable size for angling, while bluegill were small in size.  Pumpkinseed had an average length of 6.6 inches with fish measured up to 8.3 inches.  Bluegill were small in size with an average length of 5.0 inches and few fish over 7.0 inches in length.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers with fish measured in the 3.0 to 6.0 inch range.  Black crappie were not sampled in the 2001 survey.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish all had very slow growth rates. <br> 
 <br> 
Other species sampled included walleye and yellow perch.  Three walleye were sampled in the gillnets (1.5 walleye/gillnet), similar to the 2001 survey.  Sampled walleye ranged in length from 21.7 to 23.9 inches. The DNR has not stocked walleye into Beauty Lake.  Yellow perch abundance was low (0.5 perch/gillnet), similar to the previous survey in 2001. <br>

There is a primitive DNR Forestry campground with an unimproved earth ramp located on the southeast shore of the lake.  Due to its small size and low fertility, East Halverson is very susceptible to over-harvest.  Anglers must practice selective harvest it they want to improve the fishery in East Halverson.The DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into  43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  East Halverson is in lake class 21.  Other area lakes in this same classification include McCarty, Robertson, and Twenty.East Halverson provides fishing opportunities for northern pike and black crappie.  Northern pike abundance (7.5 pike/gillnet) was at the high range when compared to other class 21 lakes.  Sampled northern pike had an average length and weight of 22.3 inches and 2.6 lbs,  with pike measured up to 31.8 inches.  Northern pike growth was slow when compared to other area lakes.   A low forage base may be limiting northern pike growth.  East Halverson has an abundant black crappie population, however, crappie run small in size with few fish over 8.0 inches.  The black crappie population in East Halverson is limited by slow growth rates.Other species sampled included pumpkinseed, black bullhead, and golden shiner.  High numbers of pumpkinseed and black bullhead are present in the lake, however, they are generally not an acceptable size for angling.</p>'

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/27/2015 Clarity: 21.6' 
 Narrative = '<p>Lake Twenty-One is a small, 28 acre lake located within the Paul Bunyan State Forest in Hubbard County.  There is a public access and day-use area with picnic sites on the north shore of the lake.  There are DNR maintained primitive campground sites on the east shore and south shore between Lake Twenty-One and Nelson Lake.  Lake Twenty-One is susceptible to over-harvest from angling due to its small size, low fertility, and slow growth rates of game fish.  Anglers must practice selective harvest if they want to improve or maintain the fishery in Lake Twenty-One. <br> 
 <br> 
The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Lake Twenty-One is in lake class 36.   Class 36 lakes are small in size and have a large littoral area (area of the lake less than 15 feet in depth).  Other class 36 lakes in the Park Rapids management area include Lord, Owl, and Schroeder. <br> 
 <br> 
Lake Twenty-One provides fishing opportunities for Northern Pike, panfish, and Largemouth Bass.  Present and past surveys have shown that Lake Twenty-One supports an abundant Northern Pike population.  Sampled Northern Pike had an average length and weight of 23.9 inches and 3.2 pounds, with pike measured up to 29.4 inches.  Anglers will find moderate numbers of Largemouth Bass and a very abundant Bluegill and Pumpkinseed population.  Bluegill and Pumpkinseed tend to run small in size, with low numbers of fish over 6 inches in length sampled.  Bluegills in Lake Twenty-One have slow growth rates when compared to area lakes. <br> 
 <br> 
Currently no aquatic invasive species (AIS) have been identified in Lake Twenty-One.  To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants or animals from their watercraft and drain all water from their boat before leaving the access. <br>

Based on the assessment results, anglers should expect better than average fishing with user pressure varying from light to heavy depending on the time of year.   <br> 
      <br> 
Black crappies were abundant in the gill nets.  The majority of the crappies were less than eight inches in length with an average of 0.2 pounds.  Nonetheless, during the assessment, black crappies received all the observed fishing pressure. <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth bass were also abundant.  Bass averaged 13 inches in length and 1.3 pounds in weight.  Thirty one of the forty eight bass sampled (67%) exceeded 12 inches in length.  The largest bass caught was 17.9 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike numbers were normal for the lake type.  Pike averaged 2.9 pounds and 24.1 inches.  With five of twenty-nine fish exceeding 30 inches in length, there is potential for trophy northern pike angling. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill are more abundant than in the 2000 assessment and should provide additional opportunity to panfish anglers.  Most of the captured bluegill were 7 inches or longer, a size acceptable to many anglers looking for a meal. <br> 
 <br> 
The county owned access on Baxter Lake is unimproved with parking for approximately 6 boat trailers.</p>'

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/05/2013 Clarity: 4.1' 
 Narrative = '<p>Blue is a 309 acre lake in southwestern Isanti County. Two township- owned public accesses are located on the lake; one on the southeast shore and one on the northwest. Water clarity is moderate with algal blooms more likely as summer progresses. Boat navigation during early summercan be affected by dense stands of curlyleaf pondweed in shallower areas. The lake is well developed and popular with local pleasure boaters. Managed primarily for Walleye and Largemouth Bass, the lake is stocked annually with134 pounds of Walleye fingerlings. <br> 
 <br> 
Anglers on Blue Lake can expect moderate fishing pressure.  Largemouth Bass electrofishing found high numbers of Bass and an increase in average size. Lengths ranged from 3.7 to 18.9 inches with an average of 11.3 inches and 1.0 pounds. Walleye abundance remains at levels similar to comparable lakes and size quality remains high. Lengths ranged from 10.0 to 26.7 inches with an average of 2.6 pounds and 18.9 inches.  Northern Pike numbers in Blue Lake continue to be lower than in similar lakes, but average size remains above normal. Northern Pike averaged 24.3 inches and nearly 3.3 pounds. Bluegill abundance in the trap nets increased for the second survey in a row and is back to normal levels.  Bluegill average sized decreased, but harvestable fist are present as Bluegills up to 8.8 inches were observed.  Black Crappie abundance and size declined from the previous assessment, but with one third of the gill net catch topping 8.0 inches, harvestable Black Crappies are available to anglers.  Yellow Perch are both less plentiful and smaller than they have been, with only a few fish over 8 inches being observed. <br>

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/17/2013 Clarity: 7.8' 
 Narrative = '<p>Florence is a semi-fertile 141 acre lake located in eastern Isanti County.  A state owned access is located on the northwest corner of the lake.  The maximum depth is 26 feet but 90 percent of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  Vegetation can become dense in the shallower areas of the lake and likely facilitates the occasional winterkills that occur on the lake.  Differing levels of winterkill severity have affected and will continue to affect the fish community in Florence Lake.  Following winterkill, gamefish populations are reestablished by stocking as part of the lake management plan and by immigration from nearby water bodies. The most recent winterkill event occurred in early 2011.  While it was not a complete kill, fish species less tolerant of low oxygen levels such as Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Walleye were likely the most affected.  The lake is primarily managed for Northern Pike and secondarily for Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike catch rates were above average and sizes were below average when compared to similar lakes. Captured Northern Pike ranged from 13.6 to 33.0 inches.  Walleye are present in Florence Lake, but catch rates are below average when compared to similar lakes.  Walleyes present during the survey were a result of fry stocking in the spring of 2011.  With no natural reproduction, future Walleye abundance is dependent on the success of Walleye stockings.  Spring electrofishing found high numbers of Largemouth Bass. The 47 Largemouth Bass collected averaged 9.8 inches and 0.66 pounds with lengths ranging from 6.3 to 17.7 inches.  Most of the Bass collected in the survey were the result of spawning events that took place after the winterkill in 2011.   <br> 
 <br> 
Black Crappie catch rates in Florence Lake were low when compared to similar lakes.  The largest Black Crappie collected was 9.4 inches and the average length was 7.0 inches.  Bluegill catch rates were very high when compared to similar lakes and the catch consisted of many quality sized fish that should provide a great fishing opportunity.  The largest Bluegill collected in the survey was 8.0 inches and over half of the Bluegills observed were greater than 7 inches.  Yellow Perch abundance was low and Black Bullhead abundance was slightly above average when compared to similar lakes.  The short term reduction in fish abundance as a result of the winterkill has meant faster growth rates for the surviving fish and their newly hatched offspring.  Strong recruitment and fast growth following that winterkill event have resulted in an abundant population of catchable sized game fishes. Florence Lake will likely continue to be affected by winterkills of varying magnitude which could limit fishing potential in the future.   <br>

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/27/2013 Clarity: 1.1' 
 Narrative = '<p>Lake Francis is 301 acres with a maximum depth of eight feet. The lake is extremely fertile and turbid. The low water clarity inhibits aquatic plant growth. Although complete kills are rare, winter oxygen levels often drop low enough to cause some fish mortality. Fish migration from the Rum River repopulates the lake with gamefish, common Carp, and White Sucker. A small public access is located on the southeast end of the lake with parking for six rigs, which tends to limit summer angling pressure. Winter angling pressure has been high in recent years.  <br> 
 <br> 
Anglers visiting Francis Lake can expect quality angling for numerous species.  Black Crappies were extremely abundant.  Three fourths of Crappies sampled by the trapnets exceeded nine inches in length.  Although the bulk of Crappies sampled by gillnet were between 5 and 6 inches, more than a fourth of that catch exceeded 9 inches as well.  The Bluegill catch was more typical of the lake type but they too should provide excellent angling opportunity with 75% of the trapnet sample in excess of 8 inches.  The Northern Pike were oriented to the shoreline resulting in a higher catch in the trapnets than in the gillnets.  Eighty six percent of the pike sampled by trapnets exceeded 24 inches with thirty nine percent 30 inches or better.  The Walleye population, a result of fry stocking following low winter oxygen levels in 2009 and 2010, was a little higher than in most similar lakes.  All of these 3 and 4 year old fish were over 16 inches in length.  Like Crappies, Yellow Perch were extremely abundant.  Perch should provide additional harvest opportunity with nearly a fourth of the catch (23%) eight inches or better.  Largemouth Bass were not particularly numerous but most were between 14 and 19 inches.</p>'

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/29/2013 Clarity: 1' 
 Narrative = '<p>Long is a very fertile, 390 acre lake located in southern Isanti County. Water clarity is generally poor due to high algae densities. Aquatic vegetation is sparse most of the open water season although curly-leaf pondweed can be dense in May and early June. With a maximum depth of 15 feet and an average depth of only 5, winterkill occurs periodically on the lake. Following winterkill, gamefish populations are reestablished by stocking as part of the lake management plan. The lakeshore is highly developed with 211 lake homes and 1 resort. Public access is available on both the northeast and west central shores.  <br> 
 <br> 
Spring electrofishing found an increase in abundance of Largemouth Bass. The largest bass captured was 15.1 inches, and 5 of the 13 bass were larger than 12 inches.  An increase in the number of smaller bass in this survey bodes well for bass fishing in the future.  Northern Pike catch rates and sizes were average when compared to similar lakes. Captured Northern Pike ranged from 15.9 to 39.2 inches with an average length of 24.5 inches. Walleye are present in Long Lake, but catch rates fell to levels well below average when compared to similar lakes.  Although, Walleye caught during the survey were above average size, all being between 19 and 22 inches.  With no natural reproduction, future Walleye abundance is dependent on the success of Walleye stockings. <br> 
 <br> 
Black Crappie numbers in Long Lake are much higher than in similar lakes.  The largest Black Crappie collected was 9.6 inches and the average length was 7.5 inches.  While Black Crappie growth rates were slower than average in Long Lake, the large number of 7 to 8 inch fish observed in this survey should provide ample fishing opportunities in the near future. Bluegill catch rates decreased to below average when compared to similar lakes and were less than a third of that observed in 2004. Bluegill size was similar to the 2009 survey, with an average length of 6.6 inches.  The largest Bluegill collected in the survey was 7.7 inches and just over one fourth of the Bluegill were greater than 7 inches.  Yellow Perch abundance has remained low and bullhead and White Sucker abundance has increased since the last survey.  Provided no severe winterkills occur, Long Lake should provide great fishing opportunities in the years to come.  <br>

 Narrative = '<p>Lory is a fertile, 212 acre lake in northern Isanti County.  Lakeshore development and water clarity are fairly low.  A public boat access is located on the west side of the lake with roadside parking.  Managed primarily for Walleye and Northern Pike, the lake is stocked annually with 150 pounds of Walleye fingerlings.  Fishing pressure is low to moderate in summer and moderate to high some winters.   <br> 
 <br> 
Based on 2013 assessments results, anglers can expect good numbers of quality sized Largemouth Bass.  Bass averaged 13.4 inches and 1.5 pounds with a fourth of the catch topping 15 inches.  Northern Pike abundance increased some since 2009 with a compensatory drop in size.  Northerns average 22.3 inches and 2.4 pounds with fish over 30 inches still present.  Black Crappie remain plentiful in the lake and with bass receive the bulk of anglers' attention.  While crappie size has dipped since 2009, 30% of the catch exceeded 8 inches.  Bluegill provide additional harvest opportunity.  Present in typical abundance, the catch mirrored the 2009 data in size and number with just over 30% of the Bluegill catch topping 7 inches.  Walleye abundance remains typical of the lake's historic mean.  Hopefully, the move to annual stocking will maintain Walleye at this level or higher.  As in 2009, Walleye were atypically large with all captured fish exceeding 18 inches.  Walleye fry were stocked in May of 2013.  However, night electrofishing in September failed to sample any young of the year Walleye.  Yellow Perch numbers showed a slight increase but remain low.</p>'

 Narrative = '<p>Beauty Lake is a 217 acre lake located four miles northeast of Goodland, in the St. Louis River watershed.  Beauty Lake is in ecological lake class 29.  Class 29 lakes are relatively small lakes with moderate fertility and a high percentage of littoral area.  Other area lakes in this class include Lower Panasa, Stingy and Wilson Lakes.  Much of the shoreline of Beauty Lake is undeveloped and in a natural state.  Aquatic vegetation and coarse woody debris are found in many areas, providing good fish habitat.  A standard survey was conducted in July 2015 to assess the status of the fishery. <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth Bass were sampled in moderate numbers with spring night electrofishing and summer trap netting.  Fish from the electrofishing sample averaged 13.7 inches and 1.5 pounds while those from the trap net sample averaged 15.5 inches and 2.2 pounds.  Age analysis showed ages 2-7 were represented with the 2010 (age 5) year class most frequently sampled.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with bass averaging 13.1 inches at age 5. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye were sampled in numbers typical for this lake class and similar to recent surveys.  Sampled Walleye ranged from 9.5 to 25.6 inches with a mean length of 16.7 inches and a mean weight of 1.7 pounds.  Age analysis indicated consistent recruitment with ages 1-8 and 13 represented in the sample.  No Walleye stocking has occurred in Beauty Lake for the last 25 years and a stable population is sustained by natural reproduction.  Average growth of 19.1 inches at age 6 is similar to the statewide average. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike were captured in numbers similar to the long-term average for the lake.  Size structure of Northern Pike was generally poor; gill-net sampled pike averaged 19.8 inches and only one fish exceeded 24 inches.  One large pike (36 inches) was sampled in a trap net.  Age analysis from the gill-net sample indicated ages 2-4 were represented.  Northern Pike growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 20.2 inches at age 4.  The lack of fish over 23 inches and four years of age may be the result of angler harvest. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill were sampled in numbers below the typical range for this lake class.  Size structure was fairly good; fish from the trap net sample averaged 6.5 inches and 64% of the sample exceeded 7 inches.  The sample had a balanced age distribution with ages 2-9 represented and about half of the fish age 6 and older.  Average growth of 6.5 inches at age 6 was similar to the lake class average. <br> 
 <br> 
Black Crappie were sampled in numbers typical for this lake class.  Sampled crappie ranged from 5.1 to 11.2 inches with several year classes represented.  Crappie growth was considered average with a mean length 7.0 inches at age 3. <br>

There is a gravel public access on the east shore and the lake is lightly developed with much of the shoreline in public ownership.  Previous water chemistry sampling had low alkalinity of 20 ppm indicating low fertility.  Primary fish species include northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.      <br> 
 <br> 
The northern pike gill net catch rate was 7.0/net and was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in two past assessments have been slightly less at 2.7 and 5.3/net.  Size structure was poor with few fish larger than 24 inches sampled.  Growth was slow, but within 15% of the statewide average for fish up to age seven.  Only two age eight fish were sampled and length at age was only 23.7 inches compared to 30.5 inches for the statewide average.  Growth may be slower for larger fish due to the lack of larger prey such as white sucker or tullibee.     <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth were sampled by night electrofishing on May 21st and caught 71 fish for a catch rate of 49.4/hour indicating moderate abundance.  Previous assessments have not sampled largemouth bass in gill nets or trap nets, however, notes in the lake file indicate largemouth bass were present.  Size structure was good with fish up to 19 inches sampled.   Growth was slow, but within 15% of the statewide average with fish averaging 16.2 inches at age nine.  Ageing indicated a long lived population with fish up to age 11.     <br> 
 <br> 
The bluegill trap net catch rate was 8.2/net which was lower than the expected range.  Catch rates in past assessments have also been low varying from 2.8 to 7.4/net.  Size structure was poor with no fish 8 inches or larger sampled.  Size structure has historically been poor, with few fish larger than 7 inches sampled in past assessments.  Growth was slightly faster than the lake class average with fish averaging 6.6 inches at age seven.  Fish up to age 10 were sampled indicating a long lived population.   <br> 
 <br> 
The black crappie catch rate was 2.0/net in both gill nets and trap nets.  Both catch rates were within the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have been similar varying from 1.0 to 2.7/gill net and 0.6 to 1.0/trap net.  Size structure was good with fish up to 11 inches sampled.   Growth was slightly slower than the lake class average with fish averaging 9.2 inches at age six.  Seven year classes were sampled indicating consistent recruitment. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch gill net catch was 2.0/net, which was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in previous assessments were similar and varied from 1.0 to 4.7/gill net.  Size structure was poor and no fish larger than 7 inches were sampled.  Yellow perch are an important prey species for northern pike and low catch rates compared to many lakes may reduce growth rates and the ability to produce larger fish.   <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2010-08-16',  County Name = 'Itasca', Lake Name = 'Dock' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/16/2010 Clarity: 10' 
 Narrative = '<p>Background: <br> 
 <br> 
Dock Lake is a 31 acre lake in Itasca County near Marcell, MN and is located within the Chippewa National Forest.  The public access is located on the north end of the lake off County Road #49 and is administered by the U.S. Forest Service.  The lake has soft, infertile water, which greatly limits fish production resulting in a limited fish community.    <br> 
 <br> 
The lake management plan (LMP) for Dock Lake was last revised in 2005.  Bluegill and walleye were the primary management species.  The long range goal of the plan was to determine if walleye fingerling stocking could maintain the walleye population above 1.5/gill net and significantly increase bluegill quality with 80% of the bluegill exceeding a quality size of 6 inches and 20% exceeding the angler preferred size of 8 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
Dock Lake has a history of producing relatively slow growing bluegill with catches within the interquartile range for the lake class.  Low predator abundance was believed to contribute to the slow growth of bluegill.  Dock Lake also historically produced a modest population of walleye that typically exceeded the lake class third quartile value of 1.5/gill net.  The walleye population appeared to be maintained by limited natural reproduction.  An evaluation of the effect of walleye stocking on bluegill growth and subsequent size structure was conducted from 1990 to 2010.  The objective of this study was to determine if walleye fingerling stocking could alter the bluegill size structure or growth rates.    <br> 
 <br> 
Results: <br> 
 <br> 
The most recent population assessment was conducted on Dock Lake in August of 2010 and consisted of 4 gill net and 9 trap net sets.   Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) sampling, which involved near shore sampling, was conducted in mid-July.   <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye were caught at a rate of 3.3/gill net, which was high compared to lakes with similar habitats and above average for Dock Lake.  The long range catch rate goal of the lake management plan was exceeded.  Walleye ranged from 7 to 26 inches with an average size of 12.3 inches.   Walleye ranged in age from 1 to 7 and the 2009 year class comprised 63% of the catch.   Most walleye (72%) were associated with stocked year-classes.  Growth rates were near the statewide average until age-4, and relatively slow thereafter.   <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill were captured at a rate of 14.3/trap net, an average rate compared to similar lakes.  Size structure was poor as only 20% exceeded 6 inches and no fish exceeding 8 inches were captured.  The LMP length goals were not met as the size structure did not improve.  Growth remained relatively slow, although average compared to similar lakes, with individuals exceeding 6 inches at age-7.  The popularity of the bluegill fishery is likely limited given the poor size structure. <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie were captured at a low rate compared to similar lakes.  Crappie ranged in size from 6 to 11 inches.  Growth was near the statewide average with individuals exceeding 8 inches by age-4.  Crappie catches have typically been low in Dock Lake.  Low population size likely limits the potential of the crappie population. <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth bass were captured at a average rate compared to similar lakes.  Size ranged from 9.6 to 13 inches.  Growth was near the statewide average with individuals achieving 12 inches by age-5.   <br> 
 <br> 
Other species captured included central mud minnows.  This fish community is unique in that it historically lacked two species that are common in most other lakes in this area: northern pike and yellow perch.  Northern pike were, however, introduced (source unknown) sometime after the 1999 assessment and were captured at a rate of 1.5/gill net in 2004.  No pike were captured in the 2010 assessment. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye fingerlings were stocked at a relatively high rate every other year since 1991.  Five assessments were conducted from 1991 to 2010.  Walleye catches generally increased from 1.2/gill net in 1991 to 3.3/gill net in 2010 and the strongest year classes generally corresponded to stocked years.  Conversely, bluegill catches peaked in 1994 at 31.8/trap net and declined to 14.3/trap net in 2010.  The relationship between bluegill and walleye catches were not strongly correlated despite the general trends in catch rates.  The weak correlation suggests that walleye abundance did not strongly influence bluegill catches.  Bluegill growth rates remained poor during the evaluation period despite decreased abundance in recent years.  Total length at ages 2-8 did not significantly increase, indicating no meaningful changes in growth had occurred.  <br> 
 <br> 
The protection of water quality and habitat is critical in maintaining or improving fish and wildlife populations.  Unfortunately, human activities often negatively impact our lakes.  Fertilized turf-grass lawns and failing septic systems along with the removal of shoreline and aquatic vegetation, mowing to the shore, and installing sand blanket beaches result in destabilized shorelines, uncontrolled erosion, and increased run-off, contributing excess nutrients and sediment to the lake and degrading water quality and habitat.  By understanding the cumulative impacts of our actions and taking steps to avoid or minimize them, we can help insure our quality water resources can be enjoyed well into the future. Anglers can further help insure quality fishing by practicing selective harvest and catch and release.   <br>

 Survey Date = '2008-10-13',  County Name = 'Itasca', Lake Name = 'Erskine' 
 Lake Clarity = '' 
 Narrative = '<p>Erskine Lake is a small 40-acre water body, located in northeastern Itasca County that has 40% of its surface area over water that is less than 15 feet deep and has a maximum depth of 56 feet. The lake has good water clarity as indicated by a 16 ft Secchi disk reading and low fertility. (Total Phosphorous = 0.010 ppm or 10 ppb). The morphology and suitable environmental conditions where good oxygen levels are present in a coldwater layer during the midsummer makes this lake an ideal "designated trout lake". <br> 
 <br> 
Temperature and dissolved oxygen levels were measured during the most critical period in mid August (8/21/2008) when suitable levels for stream trout are at the most confining layer.   The lake had developed a thermocline during the summer months where a layer of water temperatures between 18 and 29 feet dropped rapidly from the low 70s to the mid-forties.  Water temperatures above the thermocline were about 74 degrees F that stream trout can tolerate for short periods while feeding.  After feeding they are able to rest in water layers with more suitable water temperatures that contained sufficient dissolved oxygen. Dissolved oxygen levels actually increased from 7.8 ppm above the thermocline to 12.5 ppm in the colder water within the thermocline and starting decreasing at the bottom of the thermocline and became insufficient (<5.0ppm) below 28 feet of water.  <br> 
 <br> 
Rainbow trout have been stocked on a biennial schedule since proposed in the 2000 management plan.  Since then rainbow trout have been stocked in the spring of 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2007.  Although rainbow trout were most recently stocked in May of 2007, 17 months previously, none were captured, indicating that each stocking is likely harvested the first year. The long-range goal for rainbow trout to provide a fishery that yields a catch rate of at least 0.2 fish/trap net was not achieved during this assessment. <br> 
 <br> 
Fingerling splake also have been stocked biennially according to the 2000 lake management plan in the fall of 2002, 2004, and 2006.  Splake from the 2006 stocking, two years survival in the lake, dominated the catch as 67 of the 69 splake caught in trap nets were 13 to 18 inches in length.  The two larger splake that were between 22 and 23 inches in length and weighted approximately 4.5 lbs were determined to be survivors from the 2004 stocking,four years previously.  The long  term goal for splake of maintaining a catch rate of 1.0 fish/trap net where 25% are greater than 16 inches in length was achieved for this assessment.  The CPUE for trap nets was 3.5 fish/trap net and a total of 81 splake were captured from both gear types and 20 fish or 25% exceeded 16 inches in length. <br> 
  <br> 
Conditions within the lake seem to support good growth for splake.  Splake from the net catches averaged about 15.0-16.0 inches and had attained a mean weight of 1.25 lbs. Although no statewide average are available for evaluating splake growth the splake from this assessment that were actually two and one/half year old fish (one-half year in the hatchery and two years in the lake) had exceeded the statewide average lengths for three- year-old rainbow trout, 12.8 inches, and three- year-old lake trout, 12.4 inches,  by approximately 20% to 25%.    <br> 
 <br> 
Two minnow traps were also set to check availability of prey species.  Species captured in order of their abundance included northern redbelly dace (45.0 /set), fathead minnow  (7.5 /set), finescale dace (6.0 /set)), and brook stickleback (4.0 /set).  <br>

High gill net catches generally correspond to poor size structure.  Despite high abundance, a 37 inch fish was sampled in 2012 and large fish have been sampled in past assessments.  Fish up to age eight were sampled and growth was slow, but within 15% of the statewide average.  Northern pike averaged 24.7 inches by age 7.   <br> 
 <br> 
The bluegill catch rate was 8.8/trap net and was towards the low end of the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have been much higher varying from 15.0 to 102.5/net.  Size structure was poor with no fish eight inches or larger sampled.  Fish up to nine inches have been sampled in past assessments indicating size structure may have declined.  Growth was slightly slower than the lake class average with fish only averaging 7.2 inches by age eight.  Since bluegill rarely live beyond age 10 it will be difficult to improve size structure unless growth rates improve. <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie gill net and trap net catches were 2.2 and 0.7/net.  The gill net catch was slightly higher than the expected range and trap net catch was towards the low end of the expected range.  Catch rates in past assessments have been highly variable, varying from 0 to 10.8/gill net and 3.3 to 23.5/trap net.  Size structure was good with fish up to 11 inches sampled.  Ageing data indicated inconsistent recruitment with two missing year classes and growth that was similar to the lake class average with fish averaging 9.9 inches by age five.     <br> 
 <br> 
The yellow perch catch rate was 1.7/gill net and was lower than the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments were higher and varied from 14.3 to 134.8/net.  Size structure was poor and no fish 9 inches or larger were sampled.  Size structure has also been poor in past assessments.  Although yellow perch are too small to interest most anglers they are an important prey species for northern pike. <br> 
 <br> 
Three walleye were sampled for a catch rate of 0.5/gill net which was below the first quartile of 1.3/net.  Walleye have not been sampled in all assessments and catch rates have varied from 0 to 1.5/gill net.  The walleye sampled were large and varied from 19.9 to 22.4 inches and were relatively old fish, aged at 9, 17, and 18 years old.  Because walleye have not been stocked in many years and many year classes are missing, the fish may have migrated from the Bigfork River.   <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth bass were also sampled in the 2012 assessment.  Largemouth bass are not sampled well by gill nets or trap nets and net catches do not accurately reflect abundance.  Gill nets sampled 11 fish for a catch rate of 1.8/net and trap nets sampled six fish for a catch rate of 0.7/net.  Gunderson Lake has the ability to produce larger fish and fish up to 18 inches were sampled.  Other species sampled include pumpkinseed sunfish and yellow bullhead. <br> 
 <br> 
Water levels appear to be much higher than normal and lakeshore residents mentioned the outlet channel is blocked by several beaver dams.  High water has accelerated shoreline erosion, killed numerous trees and blocked fish migration from the Bigfork River.  An open channel between the lake and the river may improve the fish community of Gunderson Lake.   <br>

 Survey Date = '2007-08-27',  County Name = 'Itasca', Lake Name = 'Hart' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/29/2007 Clarity: 11.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Hart Lake is a moderately sized, mesotrophic lake in southeastern Itasca County near the town of Pengilly.  The lake features moderate fertility, good water clarity, moderate residential development, and a diverse aquatic plant community.  Hart Lake supports a relatively diverse fish community, providing angling opportunities for several species.   <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike were the most common species captured in the gill net and the catch rate was within the expected range when compared to similar lakes.  About half of the captured individuals exceeded 21 inches in length, suggesting moderate angling opportunity for quality-sized pike.  Individuals exceeding 28 inches, however, were rare.  Relatively slow growth may limit the pike size structure.  Bluegill were the most common panfish in the sample, but occurred in relatively low numbers when compared to similar lakes.  The 2007 catch was the lowest observed for Hart Lake.  Historical records indicate poor bluegill size structure in Hart Lake.  In 2007, typically size remained small as only 25% of the captured individuals exceeded 6 inches.  Growth was slow, contributing to the small average size.  Black crappie were captured in relatively good abundance when compared to similar lakes.  The length distribution appeared balanced, although most individuals failed to exceed 8 inches as growth remained slow.  Largemouth bass were captured in good numbers during night electrofishing and Hart Lake may provide good angling opportunities for this species.  Slow growth appears to limit the size structure, however.   <br> 
 <br> 
Prey availability may limit the Hart Lake fishery.  Historical records indicated high tullibee abundance when compared to similar lakes.  In 2007, tullibee catches were about average when compared to similar lakes and had dropped noticeably from previous surveys as the 2007 sample resulted in the lowest point observation of tullibee from Hart Lake.  Tullibee are an import prey species and a decline of this species may negatively impact predator populations.  Yellow perch are also an important prey species.  Yellow perch have historically been sampled in low numbers from Hart Lake and remained in low abundance in 2007.  Walleye were sampled in low numbers in 2007 as only two large individuals were captured.  Walleye were not sampled in Hart Lake from 1970 through 1992.  The occurrence of walleye in Hart Lake may be a result of emigration from Swan Lake.  Currently, downstream barriers appear to limit movement between the lakes.   <br> 
 <br> 
The protection of water quality and habitat is critical in maintaining or improving fish and wildlife populations.  Unfortunately, human activities often negatively impact our lakes.  Fertilized turf-grass lawns and failing septic systems along with the removal of shoreline and aquatic vegetation, mowing to the shore, and installing sand blanket beaches result in destabilized shorelines, uncontrolled erosion, and increased run-off, contributing excess nutrients and sediment to the lake and degrading water quality and habitat.  By understanding the cumulative impacts of our actions and taking steps to avoid or minimize them, we can help insure our quality water resources can be enjoyed well into the future. Anglers can further help insure quality fishing by practicing selective harvest and catch and release.   <br>

 Survey Date = '2011-08-15',  County Name = 'Itasca', Lake Name = 'Island' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/15/2011 Clarity: 9' 
 Narrative = '<p>Island Lake is a 61-acre lake located 5 miles northwest of Taconite, MN.  The lake is the third and smallest lake in a chain of three connected lakes including O'Reilly and Shamrock Lakes.  The lake is lightly developed and has bog-stained water with a Secchi disk reading of 9.0 ft.  Previous water chemistry sampling indicated low to moderate fertility.  Island Lake is shallower and slightly more fertile than O'Reilly or Shamrock Lake.   Primary fish species include northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.   <br> 
 <br> 
The northern pike gill net catch rate was 4.3/net and was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have varied from 2.5 to 12.3/net.  Size structure was poor and only two fish over 23 inches were sampled.  Eight year classes of northern pike were sampled with fish up to age 8.  Growth was similar to the statewide average and fish averaged 25.9 inches by age 6.   <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth bass were sampled by spring electrofishing and sampled 17 fish for a catch rate of 51.0/h, indicating a moderate to abundant population.  This was the first assessment to sample largemouth bass by electrofishing.  No fish were sampled by gill nets or trap nets.  Size structure was moderate with fish up to 16 inches sampled.  Most year classes were sampled with fish up to age 8 indicating a population with good recruitment to older age classes.  Growth was slower than the statewide average with fish averaging 13.3 inches by age 6.   <br> 
 <br> 
The bluegill catch rate was 4.5/trap net and was within the expected range.  Catch rates have generally been low and varied from 2.5 to 14.0/net.  Catch rates in most years have been less than 10/trap net.  Size structure was poor with few fish larger than 6 inches and no fish larger than 8 inches sampled.  Size structure has generally been poor in most recent assessments.  Fish up to age 10 were sampled and most year classes were present.  Growth was slower than the lake class average with fish only averaging 5.8 inches by age 7 and 6.5 inches at age 9.      <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie catch rates were low, with catch rates of 0.3 and 1.3/net for gill nets and trap nets.  Catch rates in past assessments have been highly variable varying from 1.0 to 15.7/gill net.  Size structure was poor with no fish exceeding 9 inches.  Five age classes were present and fish up to age 7 were sampled.  Growth was much slower than the statewide average with fish averaging 7.5 inches by age 6, compared to 10.5 inches at age 6 for the statewide average.   <br> 
 <br> 
Common prey species such as yellow perch and tullibee were not sampled in this assessment.  Both species have been sampled in few previous assessments.  Low abundance of prey species limits growth rates and abundance of predator species such as northern pike. <br> 
 <br> 
Other species sampled by gill nets and trap nets include brown and yellow bullhead and pumpkinseed sunfish.   <br> 
 <br> 
Lakeshore owners may affect fish populations not only through harvesting fish, but also through land use practices.  It is important to leave a 30 to 50 ft buffer strip of native vegetation along the shoreline to prevent erosion and provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  Nonfunctioning septic systems can also lead to water quality problems.  Good water quality and fish populations are the direct result of good land use practices.  Anglers can also help to improve the size structure of the fish community by harvesting fewer smaller fish and releasing medium and larger fish. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2009-08-31',  County Name = 'Itasca', Lake Name = 'Jessie' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/31/2009 Clarity: 9' 
 Narrative = '<p>Jessie Lake is 1,753 acres, eutrophic lake in northern Itasca County.  The Secchi disc transparency during the 2009 assessment was 9.0 feet, indicating moderate water clarity.  The lake is fertile and is subject to seasonal algae blooms.  The lake management plan lists walleye and northern pike as the primary management species. <br> 
 <br> 
Test netting was conducted from 8/31/2009 to 9/3/2009 and consisted of 12 gill net and 12 trap net sets.  The lake survey manual recommended 15 gill net and 15 trap net sets, but a decision was made to reduce the number of sets, as the gill net catch of walleye was high and a sufficient sample size was acquired with fewer nets.  Reducing the number of nets was also required to reduce gill net mortality.  The number of gill net sets was reduced to 10 in 1999 when walleye catches were similarly high. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch were the most common species captured in both the gill nets and trap nets.  The gill net catch rate of 50.7/net was high compared to similar lakes but was near the mean for Jessie Lake (47.7/gill net), which has a history of high yellow perch catches.  Most perch were small and only 18% exceeded 8 inches.  Given the relatively poor size structure, angler interest in the perch fishery is likely limited, but some incidental harvest may occur while targeting other species. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye were the second most common species captured in the gill nets.  The catch rate of 19.3/gill net was high compared to similar lakes and well above the median of 9.2/gill net for Jessie Lake.  Walleye catches from Jessie have fluctuated considerably from a low of 3.9/gill net in 1978 to a high of 22.0/gill net in 1999.  The 2009 catch is the second highest on record.  Relatively small fish dominated the sample, as most fish were 12 to 15 inches long and were from the strong 2006 year class.  Some larger individuals were present, as walleye up to 27 inches were captured.  The 2006 year classes comprised 79% of the aged individuals.  Strong walleye year classes in Jessie Lake have historically corresponded to years in which walleye fry were stocked as is the case with the 2006 year class.  Growth was near the statewide average, with individuals typically exceeded 14 inches by age-4.   Jessie Lake has the potential to provide good walleye angling opportunities for several years given the current walleye abundance, walleye size structure, and prey base.   <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike were captured at a rate of 2.2/gill net, which is relatively low when compared to similar lakes and below the median of 3.2/gill net for Jessie Lake.  Jessie Lake has a history of relatively low pike abundance as catches have only exceeded the median for similar lakes (5.1/gill net) once, in 1958 when a catch of 8.6/gill net was recorded.  In 2009, size structure was relatively good as 58% exceeded a quality size of 21 inches, 12% exceeded the angler preferred size of 28 inches, and 8% exceeded 34 inches.  Growth was average with individuals exceeding 22 inches by age-4.  Given the current density and size structure, good angling opportunities may exist for large northern pike.  Given the low density, however, anglers should be encouraged to practice catch and release. <br> 
 <br> 
Tullibee were captured at a rate of 4.9/gill net.  This catch rate is average when compared to similar lakes.  Tullibee catches have varied considerably in Jessie Lake as catches have ranged from 0.7/gill net in 2004 to 18.5/gill net in 1974.  The tullibee is important as a prey specie and is often associated with the production of large northern pike and walleye. <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie were captured at a rate of 0.1/gill net and 0.8/trap net, within the expected range when compared to similar lakes but below average for Jessie Lake.  Size structure was moderate as most individuals range from 9 to 10 inches.  Crappie are difficult to sample in test nets and the low catch may not be indicative of abundance, but given the high walleye abundance, it is likely the crappie population is somewhat suppressed. <br> 
 <br> 
Other species captured include bowfin, rock bass, white sucker, bluegill, pumpkinseed, brown bullhead, common shiner, and largemouth bass. <br>

 Survey Date = '2009-08-17',  County Name = 'Itasca', Lake Name = 'King' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/17/2009 Clarity: 3' 
 Narrative = '<p>King Lake is a 296-acre lake located 17 miles north of Taconite, MN.  The lake is relatively shallow with a maximum depth of 23 ft and a littoral area of 141 acres.  The lake has an outlet to Balsam Lake on the south shore.  Water levels are controlled by a small control structure on the outlet and is a migration barrier for fish moving upstream.  Water quality is a concern on King Lake.  The Secchi disk transparency on August 17th was 3.0 ft and dissolved oxygen was less than 2.0 ppm below 11.0 ft.  Both measures indicate a very eutrophic system in an area of the county which generally has much better water clarity.  The lakeshore is almost entirely privately owned and there is a carry down access with a steep trail to the lake on the west shore.  The access trail is posted as nonmotorized.  Fishing pressure is considered moderate to light based on the primitive access. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike gill-net catch was 8.8/net and was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments varied from 2.0 to 8.3/net.  Size structure was good for fish 28 inches or less, but few fish were sampled greater than 28 inches.   Growth was faster than the statewide average for fish ages 1 to 3, and similar to the average for fish ages 4 to 7.  Northern pike averaged 25.3 inches by age 5.   <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie gill net catch was 26.3/net which was much higher than the expected range.  The trap net catch rate of 10.1/net was also higher than the expected range.  Catch rates in past assessments have been highly variable from 3.0 to 33.3/gill net.  Although a few larger fish were sampled, size structure was poor with most fish sampled between 6 to 7.5 inches.  Size structure may improve if this large year class survives two more years to grow large enough to interest anglers. <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth bass were sampled by spring electrofishing for the first time in this assessment.  The catch rate was 46.0 fish/hour, indicating an abundant population.  Size structure was good with fish up to 19 inches sampled.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 13.7 inches at age 5.   <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill trap net catch was 18.1/net and was similar to the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments varied from 4.3 to 59.5/trap net.  Growth was slightly faster than the statewide average for most years and fish averaged 8.0 inches by age 7.  Size structure was generally poor with few fish sampled greater than 8 inches.  Size structure may improve if a strong 2005 year class survives three more years.  <br> 
 <br> 
Gill nets sampled 31 walleye in this assessment for a catch rate of 5.2/net, which was towards the upper end of the expected range for similar lakes.  The catch rate in past assessments varied from 0 to 3.3/net, however, walleye were not sampled prior to the 1992 assessment.  Size structure was good and all fish sampled were between 20 and 27 inches.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 22.0 inches by age 9.   <br> 
 <br> 
King Lake was stocked with walleye fingerlings under permit by a private party in 1992, 1998, and 2000.  More than 50% of the walleye sampled in this assessment were from the 2000 year class, six fish were from the 1998 year class, and at least two were from the 1992 year class.  Based on this assessment and the lack of suitable spawning substrate, the walleye population in King Lake is maintained entirely through stocking. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch catch rate was 25.0/gill net and was within the expected range.  The catch rate in past assessments has varied from 7.0 to 77.8/gill net.  Size structure was poor with few fish exceeding 9 inches.    <br> 
 <br> 
Other species sampled include brown bullhead, golden shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker, and rock bass.  <br> 
 <br> 
Lakeshore owners may affect fish populations not only through harvesting fish, but also through land use practices.  It is important to leave a 30 to 50 ft buffer strip of native vegetation along the shoreline to prevent erosion and provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  Nonfunctioning septic systems can also lead to water quality problems.  Good water quality and fish populations are the direct result of good land use practices.  Anglers can also help to improve the size structure of the fish community by releasing larger fish. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2008-10-21',  County Name = 'Itasca', Lake Name = 'Kremer' 
 Lake Clarity = '' 
 Narrative = '<p>Kremer Lake has been managed for stream trout since 1927 when trout were first stocked on top of natural populations of warm water fish species.  The lake was chemically reclaimed in 1958 and again in 1974 to eliminate warm water species that would compete with stream trout.  Rainbow trout, a species popular with anglers, were stocked annually with fingerlings and/or yearlings.  Growth and survival of rainbow trout was adversely affected by the resurgence of white suckers and largemouth bass, due to competition for a limited food supply in a lake with very low fertility. It was noted in the 1993 population assessment that many of the rainbow trout did not appear as plump as fish in other area    lakes.  Subsequently, it was decided to introduce splake and brown trout, which are considered more piscivorous at larger sizes to prey on the increasingly abundant undesirable fish species.  Each species was stocked as yearlings in separate years at recommended rates of 50 fish/acre.   <br> 
 <br> 
This is the third population assessment to evaluate the performance of splake and brown trout and determine if the long range goal of the 2005 management plan was being achieved.  The long range goal was to maintain a stream trout fishery capable of producing quality sized (>16 inches) splake and brown trout and to maintain a population that yields a fall trap net catch of at least 1.5 trout per net with 20% of the catch exceeding 16 inches.  The combined catch rate for this assessment, 0.70 trout/trap net (0.5 for brown trout, 0.2 for splake), fell short of the long range goal for the third consecutive assessment. However the proportion of quality-sized fish greater than 16 inches was achieved in this assessment as forty (40%) percent of the trap netted brown trout (N=10 trout) and forty-two (42%) percent of the gill netted brown trout (N=14) exceeded 16 inches. Also the mean length of all brown trout from trap nets was 16.0 inches and 16.1 inches for one gill net set. This was the second consecutive assessment where the size structure goal was met or exceeded.   <br> 
 <br> 
Four splake were sampled in this assessment and they were all captured in trap nets. The three splake in the 13.00-13.99-length group were most likely from the stocked yearlings this spring (2008), and the larger splake from the 16.0-16.99-length group was most likely stocked as a yearling the previous year (2007). <br> 
   <br> 
Scale samples were collected from gill net captured brown trout and ages were determined from 13 of the 14 fish.   All brown trout were either age-2 or age-3.  The fish came from yearling stocked in the springs of 2006 and 2007 therefore they had survived either one and one half or two and one half years in the lake.  The age-2 brown trout ranged from 14.1 to 17.9 inches while the age-3 fish ranged from 14.3 to 16.7 inches indicating good growth for the first year and one half in the lake but slowed dramatically the second year.  All brown trout were gravid with either eggs or sperm indicating they had attained sexual maturity. Temperature and dissolved oxygen levels were measured in mid-August and revealed a thermocline occurred between 21 and 41 feet where water temperatures dropped rapidly from 71.4 to 43.3 degrees F. Dissolved oxygen levels above 5.0 ppm that is deemed the minimum to sustain stream trout occurred down to a water depth of 41 feet.  <br> 
   <br> 
Additional undesirable fish species that have repopulated the lake since the last reclamation and captured in this assessment included white suckers and largemouth bass.  Gill nets and trap nets captured 10 largemouth bass ranging from 5.0 to 13.8 inches and 16 white suckers ranging from 16.8 to 22.6 inches. This was the third consecutive assessment where golden shiners were absent which correlates with the introduction of brown trout and splake.  <br> 
 <br> 
Two minnow trap sets yielded no fish. <br>

 Survey Date = '2007-06-18',  County Name = 'Itasca', Lake Name = 'Larue Pit' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/18/2007 Clarity: 10' 
 Narrative = '<p>Larue Pit is a series of four abandoned mines, near the town of Nashwauk, that have been primarily managed for rainbow trout since 1997.  Typical to most pit lakes, the water is relatively infertile and clear.  Iron Range Resources has stocked yearling rainbow trout biannually (spring and fall) since 1997.  Walleye (1998) and adult brown trout (2001) were each stocked once.  This is the first assessment monitoring rainbow trout since stocking had begun. <br> 
 <br> 
Rainbow trout were sampled in gill nets at a rate of 1.8 fish/net.  Lengths ranged from 11.6-23.8 inches with an average length of 16.1 inches.  There were no rainbows sampled in trap nets.  Despite the difficulty in determining age and growth, length frequencies suggest there were fish from many different stockings (ages) captured in the assessment.  Having different year classes represented in the sample indicates over-winter survival and that angler harvest is not excessive.  These factors are conducive to growing relatively large rainbow trout. <br> 
 <br> 
Brook trout were sampled in gill nets and trap nets.  Gill net captured fish ranged from 10.6- 12.3 inches, averaged 11.4inches, and had a mean weight close 0.6 lbs/fish. The origins of the brook trout are unclear, however growth (mean weight and length) was relatively consistent with yearling brook trout.  There is no record of brook trout ever being stocked in the pit on file with MNDNR. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill were sampled at a rate exceeding the expected range.  Lengths ranged from 3.0-8.3 inches with an average length of 6.5 inches.  Bluegill were sampled in the 1996 assessment, however the seasons and number of nets were inconsistent between assessments.  No accurate comparisons between catch rates can be made.  Growth was consistent with relatively infertile environments, with fish up to age-8 present.	 <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth bass were sampled within the expected range.  The average length was about ten inches, and the longest was 13.2 inches.  One largemouth bass was sampled in the previous assessment.  Growth was consistent with relatively infertile environments, with fish up to age-5 present. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike were sampled at a rate below the expected range.  The two northern sampled had an average length of 20.3 inches.  More northerns were sampled in the previous assessment.  Growth was average, with fish up to age-4 present. <br> 
 <br> 
A few walleye were sampled, averaging about eighteen inches.  Growth was good with fish up to age-11 present.  Other species sampled included black crappie, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch.  <br>

 Survey Date = '2015-06-01',  County Name = 'Itasca', Lake Name = 'Little Bowstring' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/25/2015 Clarity: 4.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Little Bowstring is located about twelve miles north of Deer River, MN, within the Chippewa National Forest, and the Big Fork River watershed.  The 319 acre lake has 115 littoral acres, a maximum depth of 33 feet and a little more than three miles of shoreline.  The lake has three small inlets, from Pike Lake, Maki Lake, and Grave Lake with one outlet to the Bowstring River.  Secchi disk transparency was 4.5 feet in 2015 and the lake is considered to have moderate fertility and hardness.  All of the shoreline is in private ownership and moderately developed.  There is one public access on the south shore.  Walleye and Bluegill are primary management species with a management goal of 7.0/net for Walleye and a Bluegill summer trap net catch of 5.0/net with PSD and RSD-8 values of 40 and 20.  Northern Pike and Black Crappie are secondary management species. <br> 
 <br> 
This was the second targeted Bluegill and Black Crappie survey conducted in the spring when they are most susceptible.  The first spring assessment (2000) only measured Bluegill.  Catches and composition from spring surveys tend to be variable due to spring weather patterns and the progression of spawning activity and should be viewed cautiously.  Growth statistics and the range of lengths collected during this period tend to be relatively reliable.  However, size structure indices can be biased by the variability in daily catches related to water temperature and seasonal timing. <br> 
 <br> 
Trap net catch rates for Bluegill exceeded those from 2000, yet were lower than those from other area Bluegill lakes.  Summer assessments have typically sampled Bluegill in low numbers with catch rates below the expected range for similar lakes.  Low population densities often exhibit quality size structure.  Lengths ranged from 3.1 to 9.9 inches with an average length of 6.5 inches, which is similar to what was observed in summer assessments. <br> 
 <br> 
Sex determination identified a fairly even distribution between males and females.  Scale analysis identified ages 2 to 9 present with a somewhat even distribution of ages.  Ages between males and females were also fairly evenly distributed.  The even distribution suggests consistent natural reproduction.  Mean length was comparable to lakes similar to Little Bowstring at age 1, while length at age for age 2 and older individuals exceeded lake class averages.  Both males and females averaged over 8 inches by age 7. <br> 
 <br> 
A total of 24 Black Crappie were sampled above the previous spring assessment.  Catch rates from summer assessments have typically been low, usually below the expected range.  Size structure was good with lengths from 7.7 to 13.2 inches and an average length of 9.3 inches, similar to summer assessments.  Scale analysis identified ages 3 to 6 present with age 3 comprising 80% of the sample.  The Black Crappie population is similar to that of other area lakes, and demonstrates a boom/bust nature.  Black Crappie growth was fast, exceeding statewide averages for all ages, with fish averaging 10.7 inches by age 4. <br>

 Survey Date = '2012-06-11',  County Name = 'Itasca', Lake Name = 'Little Split Hand' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/14/2012 Clarity: 8' 
 Narrative = '<p>Background <br> 
 <br> 
Little Splithand Lake is located about 16 miles southeast of Grand Rapids, MN.  It is in ecological lake class #29 and the Mississippi River watershed.  It is connected to the Mississippi River and to Split Hand Lake by Split Hand Creek.  Little Split Hand has a total surface area of 223 acres, a littoral area of 140 acres (63%) and a maximum depth of 25 feet.  Little Split Hand is a shallow, fertile lake that frequently experiences algae blooms, although the Secchi disk reading of 8 feet in June of 2012 indicated good water clarity at the time.  The lake is moderately developed with homes along the north and east shorelines.  There is a public access on the north shore but launching boats can be difficult during low water.  The lake is ringed with emergent and floating leaf vegetation and supports a diverse aquatic plant community.  A diverse plant community is an important attribute as it provides valuable cover for fish and wildlife.  <br> 
 <br> 
 A population assessment was conducted in 2012 to determine the status of the fish community.  The assessment consisted of electrofishing for bass in May and test netting in June.  The test netting consisted of 6 gill nets and 9 trap nets.  Bony structures were collected from bass, walleye, northern pike, black crappie, and yellow perch.  Structures were not collected from bluegill, as a recent spring assessment described age diversity.   <br> 
 <br> 
Results <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch were the most common fish in the gill nets and have typically been abundant in Little Split Hand.  The catch was high compared lakes with similar habitats and above average for Little Split Hand Lake.  The size structure was poor, as most perch were less than 8 inches in length.  Five year classes were present (ages 2-6) and growth was poor with individuals typically exceeding 6 inches by age 4.  Poor size structure likely limits the popularity of the fishery, but perch provide a good prey base for other gamefish.   <br> 
 <br> 
Past sampling suggests an abundant crappie population with poor size structure.  Black crappies were the second most common fish in the gill nets and the catch was high compared to similar lakes.  Crappie ranged from 4.8 to 11.0 inches in length with a mean of 7.9 inches.  The size structure remained poor, as few crappies exceeded 10 inches.  Past assessments indicate poor growth rates compared to the statewide average.  The growth rate remained poor in 2012 as crappie did not achieve 8 inches until age 5 and 10 inches until age 8.  Recruitment appeared inconsistent in recent years, as the 2008 year class comprised 53% of the catch.  Little Split Hand Lake should provide good angling opportunities for high catches of small crappie, given the population density and size structure. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike have historically been captured in high numbers from Little Split Hand Lake.  The catch in 2012 was high compared to similar lakes.  When northern pike occur at high density, average size is typically small and growth is poor.  The size structure was poor in 2012 as 42% exceeded 21 inches and 10% exceeded the angler preferred size of 28 inches.  Some larger pike were present, however, as pike ranged from 10.2 inches to 36.5 inches and averaged 21.2 inches in length.  Growth rates were near the statewide average, as pike typically exceeded 21 inches by age 4 and 28 inches by age 7.  Age distribution was poor, as only 16% of the sample exceeded age 5 and captured pike averaged 3.6 year of age.  Poor age distributions may indicate high adult mortality, high angler harvest of adult fish, and/or poor recruitment in the recent past.  Anglers are encouraged to help improve the pike size structure by harvesting small pike and releasing pike over 22 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Lakes with habitats similar to Little Split Hand typically produce low walleye catches.  The 2012 catch was average compared to similar lakes and average for Little Split Hand.  Size structure was favorable for anglers as walleye ranged from 10.4 to 25.5 inches with an average length of 18.4 inches.  Too few walleye were captured to provide meaningful age and growth data, but growth rates appeared to be good with walleye exceeding 15 inches by age 4.   Low abundance likely limits the popularity of the walleye fishery.   <br> 
 <br> 
The electrofishing catch of largemouth bass was below average for area lakes and suggest a low density population.  Size structure was favorable, as bass ranged from 7.6 to 19.8 inches with a mean of 16.5 inches.  Growth rates were near the statewide average, as individuals typically exceeded 12 inches by age 4 and 15 inches by age 6.  Recruitment appeared inconsistent and poor in recent years, as 95% of sampled bass exceeded age 5 and captured bass averaged 7 years of age.   Good opportunities to catch large bass appear to exist given the favorable size structure. <br> 
 <br> 
Little Split Hand Lake supports a quality bluegill population.  A reduced bag limit (5 fish) was implemented in March of 2012 to help protect quality of the resource. Little Split Hand has a history of relatively low bluegill catches compared to similar lakes.  The 2012 catch was near the average for Little Split Hand Lake.  A spring assessment in May of 2012 described a favorable size structure, as 28% of the sampled bluegill exceeded 8 inches.  The summer netting suggested a poor size structure, however, as most fish failed to exceed 6 inches.  The discrepancies in the test netting suggest that the timing of assessments is important to describe the bluegill population and that targeted spring assessments are needed to document changes in size and age structure. <br> 
 <br> 
Little Split Hand Lake has a very diverse fish community.  Other captured species included brown bullhead, bowfin, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, short head redhorse, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> 
 <br> 
Mystery snails have been documented in Split Hand Lake. The Chinese mystery snail is native to Asia. It was brought to California in 1892 as a food source and found in Massachusetts in 1915, likely an aquarium release. The historic range of the banded mystery snail is the southeastern U.S., primarily in the Mississippi River system up to Illinois. It is a popular aquarium snail that's been released in Minnesota.  Both snails can form dense aggregations and disrupt native populations.  Snail die off are often considered a nuisance by landowners as dead snails litter the lakeshore.  Anglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.    <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2004-06-21',  County Name = 'Itasca', Lake Name = 'Long' 
 Lake Clarity = '' 
 Narrative = '<p>Long Lake is a small lake located in southeastern Itasca County, east of Goodland, MN.  The lake has a maximum depth of 84 ft and a littoral area of 44 acres.   There is a county owned access on the southeast shore.  The lake has limited littoral area and phosphorous levels less than 0.01 ppm, indicating low fertility.  Lakes like Long Lake which have low fertility and are relatively deep and clear generally have lower catch rates of gamefish compared to shallower more fertile lakes.Northern pike gill-net catch was 1.8/net, which was lower than the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rate in past assessments have also been low, varying from 1.2 to 4.0/gill net.  Although abundance was low, size structure was good with fish up to 38 inches sampled.  Growth was very fast with fish averaging 30 inches by age four, compared to 21 inches by age four for the statewide average.  Fast growth rates indicate that Long Lake has the ability to produce some very large northern pike.  Anglers and spearers can help to improve the size structure of northern pike by releasing or not harvesting fish between 24 to 36 inches.  Few lakes in Itasca County have growth rates this fast, and releasing the medium-sized fish allows them to reach their trophy potential.Bluegill trap net catch rate was 41.2/net, which was towards the upper end of the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rate in past assessments have varied from 19.3 to 41.8/trap net.  Size structure was moderate with a good number of fish between 6 to 7 inches, but few fish exceeding 8 inches.  Growth was similar to the lake class average with fish averaging 6 inches by age six.Black crappie trap-net catch was 2.1/net, which was also towards the upper end of the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rate in past assessments has varied from 0.6 to 4.5/trap net.  Size structure was good with fish up to 11 inches sampled.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 9 inches at age five.  Largemouth bass were sampled by electrofishing on 6/16/2004.  Catch rate was 136/hour, indicating an abundant population.  Size structure was moderate with many smaller fish under 12 inches and a moderate number between 12 to 15 inches.  Growth was slower than the statewide average, but still within 15% of the average.  Largemouth bass averaged 14 inches by age seven.Yellow perch catch rate was 4.3/gill net, which was within the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rate in past assessments varied from 2.8 to 28/net.  Size structure was moderate with a few up to 9 inches present.  Growth was slower than the statewide average with fish averaging 7 inches by age six.  Other species sampled include pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  </p>'

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2014-08-11',  County Name = 'Itasca', Lake Name = 'Lower Panasa' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/11/2014 Clarity: 2.6' 
 Narrative = '<p>Lower Panasa Lake is located 1.5 miles southeast of Calumet, Minnesota in the Mississippi River Watershed.  Lower Panasa Lake has a total surface area of 254 acres, a littoral area of 169 acres (67%), and a maximum depth of 25 feet.  The lake is moderately fertile and the Secchi depth was 2.6 feet in 2014.  The lake has one inlet and one outlet, both by the name Panasa Creek.  The Lower Panasa Lake outlet flows into the Swan River.  The lake is managed for Walleye, Black Crappie, and Northern Pike. <br> 
 <br> 
A population assessment was conducted in August of 2014 to assess the fish community.  This assessment consisted of 6 gill nets and 9 trap nets. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch were the most common fish in the gill net sample.  The catch of 44.5 per net was high compared to similar lakes, but typical for Lower Panasa.   Lengths ranged from 5.1 to 9.8 inches and averaged 6.3 inches.  Size structure was poor, as few fish exceeded the quality size of 8 inches.   Perch populations often exhibit variable year class production.  Only 4 year classes were present (ages 2-5) and the 2011 year class comprised 68% of the sample.  Growth was near the statewide average, as perch averaged 7.5 inches by age 5.  Poor size structure may limit angler popularity in Lower Panasa, but perch provide an important prey item for Walleye and Northern Pike. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike catches have been variable but generally appear to increase over time.  Northern Pike populations typically exhibit density dependent growth.  Average size and growth are typically poor when Northern Pike occur at high densities.  The 2014 catch of 11.0 per gill net was typical for lakes with similar habiatats and near the long term average for Lower Panasa.  Past samples have resulted in moderate size structure with few fish exceeding the angler preferred size of 28 inches.  Pike length ranged from 14.8 to 27.9 inches and averaged 21.2 inches in 2014, and size structure was poor, as no captured fish exceeded 28 inches.   Five year classes were present (age 2-6) and growth was near the statewide average as pike grew to 26.4 inches by age 6. <br> 
 <br> 
Similar lakes typically do not support large Walleye catches and past samples from Lower Panasa have resulted in a Walleye catch of less than 3.5 per gill net, despite frequent stocking.  The 2014 catch of 1.2 per gill net was within the expected range for the lake class and near the long term median for Lower Panasa.  Walleye length ranged from 10 to 25 inches with an average of 19.2 inches.  Size structure was good as 43% of the sampled Walleye exceeded the angler preferred length of 20 inches.  Past assessment have shown the Walleye population is maintained primarily by fry stocking.  Six of the seven captured Walleye in 2014 corresponded to a fry stocked year.  Growth was fast as Walleye averaged 19.8 inches by age 5.   <br> 
 <br> 
Black Crappie populations often exhibit irregular recruitment resulting in dominant year classes, shifting age and size structures, and inconsistent angler success.  Crappie catches have varied considerably in Lower Panasa Lake.  No crappie were captured in the gill net in 2014, and the trap net catch of 0.6 per net was less than expected.  Captured crappie were generally small, averaging 5.2 inches.  Poor size and low abundance may limit the popularity of the crappie fishery. <br> 
 <br> 
Other species sampled include Black Bullhead, Bluegill, Bowfin, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed, Shorthead Redhorse, Silver Redhorse, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> 
 <br> 
Anglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.    <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2014-07-07',  County Name = 'Itasca', Lake Name = 'McKinney' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/07/2014 Clarity: 6' 
 Narrative = '<p>McKinney Lake is a small, moderately fertile lake located in Grand Rapids, Minnesota.  McKinney Lake has a surface area of 115 acres, a littoral area of 99 acres, and a maximum depth of 34 feet. The water was bog stained with a Secchi disk transparency of 6 feet.  McKinney Lake is within the Mississippi River Watershed, receiving water from a bog on the northwest shore with an outlet to Ice Lake.   <br> 
 <br> 
The Fisheries Lake Management Plan (LMP) was last revised in 2002.  Northern Pike and Black Crappie were the primary management species and Largemouth Bass and Bluegill were secondary species.  A population assessment was conducted in July of 2014 to assess the status of the fish community.  This assessment consisted of 4 gill nets and 8 trap nets. <br> 
 <br> 
Black Crappie were the most common fish captured in gill nets.  The catch was the highest recorded for McKinney Lake, and was high compared to lakes with similar habitats.  Size structure was poor as crappie length ranged from 5.8 to 10.8 inches and averaged 7.2 inches.  Black Crappie populations often exhibit irregular recruitment resulting in dominant year classes, shifting age and size structures, and inconsistent angler success.  Size structure is expected to vary with recruitment.  Six year classes were present (age 2-8) and the 2011 and 2010 year classes comprised 45% and 27% of the catch.  Growth was somewhat slow as crappie averaged 8.2 inches by age 5.   <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike populations typically exhibit density dependent growth.  Average size and growth are typically poor when pike occur at high densities so lower densities are often desirable.  The 2014 catch was the highest observed for McKinney Lake and was high compared to similar lakes.   Despite the high density, size structure was good, as pike ranged from 18.5 to 31.5 inches and averaged 24.5 inches.  PSD (21 inches) was 84 and RSD-P was 14, meeting the goals outlined in 2002.  Many pike populations are dominated by younger fish, with few fish exceeding age 5.  In contrast, 30% of the sampled pike from McKinney were age-7 or older, suggesting low adult mortality.  Growth was near the statewide average as pike averaged 23.7 inches by age 6.  Low adult harvest has probably contributed to the good size structure.  Angler can help maintain pike quality by releasing pike over 22 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
McKinney Lake has a long history of poor perch catches.  The Yellow Perch catch was low compared to similar lakes, but typical for McKinney Lake.  Yellow Perch appear to occur at too low of a density and are too small to interest anglers but may provide an important prey item for predatory fish.  High pike numbers likely contribute to the low catch of Yellow Perch. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegills were captured at a rate typical for the lake type, but below average for McKinney Lake. McKinney Lake has a long history of producing small Bluegill.  In 2014, size structure was similar to past assessments as Bluegill ranged from 3.1 to 8.4 inches with an average of 5.3 inches.  Seven year classes were present and recruitment appeared inconsistent.  Growth was near the lake class average with Bluegill averaging 6.5 inches by age 7.   <br> 
 <br> 
Other species sampled included Bowfin, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, and Yellow Bullhead. <br> 
 <br> 
McKinney Lake is infested with Eurasian Milfoil.  The City owned boat launch has been closed for summer use but anglers can carry in small boats or canoes. The access is open for winter use.  Anglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.    <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2008-08-25',  County Name = 'Itasca', Lake Name = 'Moose' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/25/2008 Clarity: 13' 
 Narrative = '<p>Moose Lake is a moderately sized, mesotrophic, class 25 lake in northern Itasca County near the town of Northome.  The lake is moderately fertile and has good water clarity.  Most of the shoreline is in a natural state consisting primarily of forest and secondarily of bog.  Moose Lake is situated in the Big Fork River/ Moose Brook minor watershed and has four inlets of wetland origin.  There is a connection to Big Calf Lake via the outlet, Moose Brook. <br> 
 <br> 
A diverse aquatic plant community is a major attribute of Moose Lake, providing valuable habitat for a variety of fish species.  Submergent plants were widespread, growing to a depth of 13 feet.  Sago pondweed, coontail, and flatstem pondweed were the most widespread submergent plants.  Floating leaf and emergent vegetation were also widespread.  Yellow and white waterlilies were the most common floating leaf species.  The emergent plant community was diverse.  Hardstem bulrush and arrowhead (Sagittaria spp) were the most widespread emergent species and occurred around much of the lake.  Thirteen terrestrial species were found on the shoreline with sedges being the most widespread. <br> 
 <br> 
Moose Lake supports a relatively diverse fish community, providing angling opportunities for several species.  Yellow perch were the most common fish captured in gill nets.  The yellow perch catch was high when compared to similar lakes.  Yellow perch have historically been abundant in Moose Lake. The size structure was generally poor, however, as only 11% of individuals exceeded 8 inches in length.  Given the size structure and relative abundance, yellow perch appear to be a very important prey species in Moose Lake. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye were sampled in relatively high numbers in 2008.  The catch rate of 9.4/gill net was the second highest recorded for Moose Lake and was high compared to similar lakes.  Prior to 1996, Moose Lake produced walleye catches that were average for the type of lake.  Since 1996, catch rates have been relatively high.  In 2008, size structure was favorable for anglers as 44% exceeded 15 inches.  The largest fish sampled exceeded 24 inches.  Growth was near the statewide average and individuals exceeded 15 inches by age 5.  Few individuals (15%) exceeded age 5, suggesting high mortality of older, larger individuals.  Skewed age distributions are often the result of relatively high angler harvest of larger, older fish.  Given the abundance and size distribution, quality angling opportunities exist for this species. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike were sampled in relatively high numbers as well.  Prior to 1981, Moose Lake produced pike with relatively low catches when compared to similar lakes.  Since 1981, the catches have been relatively high suggesting a trend of increased abundance.  In 2008, size structure was poor as few individuals reached quality size.  When pike occur at high densities, size is often poor, limiting angler interest.  Age analysis identified eight year-classes.  Growth was near the statewide average with individuals typically exceeding 21 inches by age 5.  Few individuals exceeded age-5, contributing to the poor size distribution.  Given the poor size and age structures, the popularity of the northern pike fishery may be limited.  Anglers are encouraged to release pike over 22 inches to improve the size and age distributions.   <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie catches from Moose Lake have been relatively low in most assessments.  The current assessment resulted in a catch rate of 0.2/trap net and 0.6/gill net, indicating relatively low abundance compared to similar lakes.  Most individuals were large as length ranged from 8 to 12 inches.  Age analysis identified five year-classes and growth was near the statewide average with individuals exceeding 8 inches by age 4.   <br> 
 <br> 
Test net sampling often inadequately samples largemouth bass.  Largemouth bass were sampled using night boat electrofishing in June.  Largemouth bass were captured in low numbers (2.3/hour on-time).  Natural reproduction appears to be good, however, as special electrofishing resulted in a 41.5 YOY largemouth bass per hour.  More data is needed to thoroughly evaluate the bass population of Moose Lake. <br> 
 <br> 
Natural shoreline characteristics and good water quality are major attributes of Moose Lake. The protection of water quality and habitat is critical in maintaining or improving fish and wildlife populations.  Unfortunately, human activities often negatively impact lakes.  Fertilized turf-grass lawns and failing septic systems along with the removal of shoreline and aquatic vegetation, mowing to the shore, and installing sand blanket beaches results in destabilized shorelines, uncontrolled erosion, and increased run-off, contributing excess nutrients and sediment to the lake and degrading water quality and habitat.  By understanding the cumulative impacts of our actions and taking steps to avoid or minimize them, we can help insure our quality water resources can be enjoyed well into the future. A complete description of shoreline best management practices can be found in "Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality" at the Grand Rapids Area Fisheries Office or online at www.mndnr.gov. <br>

 Survey Date = '2011-08-08',  County Name = 'Itasca', Lake Name = 'O'Reilly' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/08/2011 Clarity: 13' 
 Narrative = '<p>O'Reilly Lake is a 202-acre lake located 5 miles northwest of Taconite, MN.  The lake is the largest lake in a chain of three connected lakes including Shamrock and Island Lake.  The lake is moderately developed with clear water and a Secchi disk reading of 13 ft.  Previous water chemistry sampling indicated low fertility which negatively affects growth rates and abundance of the fishery.  Primary fish species include northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.   <br> 
 <br> 
The northern pike gill net catch rate was 4.7/net and was similar to the average for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have varied from 2.8 to 9.5/net.  Size structure was moderate and most fish sampled were less than 25 inches.  One 34 inch fish was sampled indicating the lake has the potential to produce larger northern pike.  Five year classes of northern pike were sampled with ages 2 to 5 and age 8 represented.  Growth was similar to the statewide average and fish averaged 23.6 inches by age 5.  Only one fish older than age 5 was sampled and size structure could be improved if a greater proportion of fish survived to older age classes.  Angler harvest is likely limiting survival and size structure of the population. <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth bass were sampled by spring electrofishing and sampled 50 fish for a catch rate of 49.9/h, indicating a moderate to abundant population.  This was the first assessment to sample largemouth bass by electrofishing.  Ten fish were also sampled by gill nets or trap nets.  Size structure was moderate with fish up to 17 inches sampled.  Most year classes were sampled with fish up to age 9 indicating a population with good recruitment to older age classes.  Growth was slightly slower than the statewide average with fish averaging 13.6 inches by age 6.   <br> 
 <br> 
The bluegill catch rate was 6.7/trap net and was slightly lower than the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates have generally been higher and varied from 6.8 to 22.5/net.  Size structure was poor and only one fish sampled was larger than 8 inches and most fish were less than 6 inches.  Size structure has generally been poor in most assessments.  Fish up to age 10 were sampled and most year classes were present.  Growth was slower than the lake class average with fish only averaging 5.8 inches by age 7 and 6.8 inches at age 9.  Bluegill rarely live beyond age 10 and although survival to older age classes appears good, slow growth limits the potential to produce fish larger than 8 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie catch rates were low, with catch rates of 1.2 and 1.3/net for gill nets and trap nets.  Catch rates were within the expected range for similar lakes for both gears.  Catch rates in past assessments have varied from 0 to 6.0/gill net.  Although sample size was low size structure was good with fish up to 11 inches sampled.  Seven age classes were present and fish up to age 11 were sampled.  Growth was much slower than the statewide average with fish averaging 10.0 inches by age 8, compared to 12.3 inches at age 8 for the statewide average.  Similar to bluegill, slow growth limits the potential to produce large black crappie. <br> 
 <br> 
Common prey species such as yellow perch and tullibee were not abundant in O'Reilly Lake.  No yellow perch were sampled in this assessment and catch rates have been less than 1.0/net when they have been sampled.  Tullibee catch rate was 0.7/gill net which was less than the expected range for similar lakes.  Tullibee catch rates in past assessments have varied from 0.7 to 14.4/gill net.  Low abundance of prey species limits growth rates and abundance of predator species such as northern pike. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye have been stocked several times and have been sampled in very low numbers in past assessments.  Walleye stocking was discontinued in 1988 due to low catch rates and lack of suitable prey to support additional predator species.  No walleye were sampled in this assessment and O'Reilly Lake is best suited for northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  <br> 
 <br> 
Other species sampled by gill nets and trap nets include bowfin, brown and yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass and white sucker.  Nearshore seining and electrofishing also sampled Iowa and Johnny darters, bluntnose minnow, burbot, central mudminnow and tadpole madtom in addition to young-of-the-year gamefish species already sampled by gill net and trap nets. <br> 
 <br> 
Lakeshore owners may affect fish populations not only through harvesting fish, but also through land use practices.  It is important to leave a 30 to 50 ft buffer strip of native vegetation along the shoreline to prevent erosion and provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  Nonfunctioning septic systems can also lead to water quality problems.  Good water quality and fish populations are the direct result of good land use practices.  Anglers can also help to improve the size structure of the fish community by harvesting fewer smaller fish and releasing medium and larger fish. <br>

Pickerel Lake is managed primarily for bluegill, walleye, and black crappie.  The long range goals from the 2008 lake management plan were to increase walleye gill net abundance to 2.5/gill net, and maintain a quality bluegill population with a spring or summer trap net catch of 6.0/net and with 50% exceeding 6 inches and 30% exceeding 8 inches.   <br> 
Pickerel Lake was included in a 17 to 26 inch protected slot length limit for walleye with only one fish over 26 inches in possession implemented at the start of the 2005 walleye opener.   Pickerel lake was also included in a 10 sunfish daily/possession bag limit was implemented at the start of the 2006 fishing season.  These regulations also apply to connected Deer and Battle Lakes. <br> 
 <br> 
A population assessment was conducted on Pickerel Lake in mid-July of 2010.  The assessment consisted of 6 gill nets and 9 trap nets.  The lake was also included in near-shore IBI sampling that included backpack electrofishing and beach seining. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike were the most common species captured in the gill net.  The catch rate was within the expected range when compared to similar lakes and about average for Pickerel Lake.  The size structure was moderate as pike ranged from 17.1 to 28.4 inches with a mean of 22.2.  Few fish exceeded the angler preferred size of 28 inches.  Five year classes were identified and recruitment appeared somewhat inconsistent as no age-1 or age-2 individuals were captured.  Growth was near the statewide average with individuals exceeding 21 inches by age-4.  The lack of individuals exceeding 28 inches may limit the popularity of the northern pike fishery. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch were the second most common species in the gill net.  The catch rate was below the relatively low compared to similar lakes.  Pickerel Lake has a history of low perch catches.  Yellow perch were generally too small to be of interest to anglers and the average size was 5.3 inches and no perch over 6 inches were captured.   <br> 
 <br> 
The long range goal of catching 2.5 walleye/gill net was not met as walleye were captured at a low rate compared to similar lake.  Lakes with similar habitat and water chemistry typically support relatively few walleye.  Walleye ranged in length from 11.4 to 19.9 inches.  Only four were aged from the gill net sample and four year classes were identified.  Walleye fry are stocked in Pickerel Lake in odd numbered years.  Interestingly, 3 of the 4 aged walleye were from even numbered, non-stocked, years.  Growth was average with individuals exceeding 14 inches by age-4.  Low abundance likely limits the popularity of the walleye fishery. <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie were captured at rates expected rates for the lake class and near average for Pickerel Lake.  The size structure was moderate as crappies ranged from 4.3 to 10.6 inches.  Five year classes were identified but most individuals (79%) belonged to the 2005 year class.  Inconsistent recruitment of black crappie is a common life history trait for many populations, often resulting in "boom and bust" angling cycles.  Growth was slow with individuals typically exceeding 8 inches by age-6. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill were captured at a rate within the expected range for the lake class and above the lake average.  The goals of the long range plan were not met as size structure was relatively poor.  Past assessments have typically indicated a quality fishery.  Spring assessments conducted in 2007 and 2009 both sampled moderate numbers of quality sized fish, although the 2009 assessment suggest that the quality of the fishery may be in decline.  The 2010 assessment caught few bluegill over 6 inches.  Growth rates in 2009 were slower than previous assessments but average for the lake class.  Age structures were not collected in 2010. <br> 
 <br> 
Tullibee (Cisco) were captured at an average rate compared to similar lakes.  Tullibee are likely an important prey species in Pickerel Lake, especially given the history of low perch abundance.  Pickerel Lake is closed to tullibee netting. <br> 
 <br> 
Other species captured include: white sucker, Johnny darter, bluntnose minnows, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and rock bass.  Pickerel Lake has historically produced relatively small bass catches.  Bass were not captured in the standard nets but juveniles and young of the year were captured during the IBI survey.   <br> 
 <br> 
The protection of water quality and habitat is critical in maintaining or improving fish and wildlife populations.  Unfortunately, human activities often negatively impact our lakes.  Fertilized turf-grass lawns and failing septic systems along with the removal of shoreline and aquatic vegetation, mowing to the shore, and installing sand blanket beaches result in destabilized shorelines, uncontrolled erosion, and increased run-off, contributing excess nutrients and sediment to the lake and degrading water quality and habitat.  By understanding the cumulative impacts of our actions and taking steps to avoid or minimize them, we can help insure our quality water resources can be enjoyed well into the future. Anglers can further help insure quality fishing by practicing selective harvest and catch and release.   <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2010-06-07',  County Name = 'Itasca', Lake Name = 'Shallow Pond' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/07/2010 Clarity: 9' 
 Narrative = '<p>Background <br> 
 <br> 
Shallow Pond Lake is located in the Chippewa National Forest and the Big Fork River watershed south of Northome, Minnesota.  It is in ecological lake class #39.  Lakes in this classification are moderate in size, relatively shallow, and have moderately clear, hard water.  Shallow Pond Lake is 176 acres and has a maximum depth of 14 feet.  Water quality analysis in 1989 showed that the lake was very fertile with high phosphorous levels and a Secchi disk reading of only 2 feet.  The Secchi disk reading in June of 2010 was 9 feet, indicating that the lake can be relatively clear for at least part of the year. Shallow Pond Lake receives water from Island Lake and outlets to the Popple River.  The Popple River forms a relatively open system with broad connections to other water bodies and Shallow Pond is believed to benefit from fish moving into and out of the lake.  There is a public access on the north end of the lake owned by the U.S. Forest Service.  A few dwellings exist near the lakeshore, but much of the shoreline is in a natural state.  The lake supports a diverse aquatic plant community which includes abundant emergent and floating leaved plants.  A diverse plant community is an important attribute in keeping a desirable fish community in Shallow Pond Lake.   <br> 
 <br> 
The lake management plan for Shallow Pond Lake was last revised in 2004.  Walleye and northern pike were identified as the primary management species and black crappie were listed as a secondary species.  The long range goals of the lake management plan were to increase walleye gill net abundance to 5.8/gill net.  To accomplish this goal, Pike River strain walleye fry were stocked biennially at the rate of 1000/acre starting in 2004.  No experimental of special regulations exist for Shallow Pond Lake but statewide seasons and limits apply. <br> 
 <br> 
Assessment Results <br> 
 <br> 
Test netting was conducted on Shallow Pond Lake in early June of 2010.  Shallow Pond Lake was also included in near shore index of biological integrity (IBI) sampling in mid-July of 2010.  <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch were the most common fish captured in the gill net sample.  The catch was high compared to lakes with similar habitats and was somewhat above average for Shallow Pond.  Shallow Pond Lake has a long history of high perch catches.  Most perch were relatively small, averaging 7.9 inches.  Some quality sized perch were capture as 44% exceeded 8 inches.  The largest perch captured was nearly 12 inches in length.  Sixty-four percent of the sampled perch had parasitic yellow grub, which may limit angler popularity of the fishery.   <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike were the second most common fish in the gill net sample.  The catch was high compared to similar lakes but below average for Shallow Pond Lake.  Shallow Pond has excellent northern pike spawning habitat and has historically supported high pike catch rates.  When northern pike occur at high density, average size is typically small and growth is often poor.  The 2010 sample indicated a moderate size distribution.  Northern pike lengths ranged from 14.1 to 29.1 inches and averaged 21.5 inches.  Many pike exceeded 21 inches, but few angler-preferred pike were present as only 5% exceeded 28 inches.  Age analysis identified 7 year classes. Most pike were relatively young, averaging 3.4 years of age, and only 17% of the sampled pike were 5 years old or older.  The lack of older pike may indicate high mortality of older pike or high emmigration rates of adult pike from Shallow Pond Lake.  Growth was near the statewide average with individuals typically exceeding 21 inches by age 4. The lake appears to be an important rearing area for young pike in the Popple River system and it is doubtful that meaningful improvements in pike size distribution could be achieved given the amount and quality of the spawning habitat.   <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye were captured at a comparable rate to catches from similar lakes, and above average for Shallow Pond Lake.  The catch rate was just below the goal of the lake management plan.  Captured walleye were generally large, as length ranged from 11.3 to 26.5 inches and averaged 20 inches.  Most walleye exceeded 15 inches and many exceeded 20 inches.  Age analysis identified 7 year classes.  Fewer than half of the captured walleye corresponded to a stocked year.  Walleye were generally older individuals, averaging 7 years of age.  Eighty five percent of the sampled walleye exceeded age-5.  Growth was near the statewide average with individuals typically exceeding 16 inches by age 5.  The lack of young walleye in Shallow Pond Lake may suggest that the lake does not function as a walleye rearing area, but does provide important habitat for transient adult walleyes as they move through the system.  Shallow Pond Lake may be an important feeding area for adult walleye, given the history of high perch catches.  The lake appears to support excellent angler opportunities for large walleye, given the relative abundance and favorable size distribution of this species.  <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie were captured at a relatively low rate but about average for Shallow Pond Lake.  The lake has a history of low crappie catches, which likely limits the popularity of the fishery.  Captured crappies were large, ranging from 11.5 to 12.7 inches, and the size distribution suggests that modest angling opportunities may exist for large individuals.   <br> 
 <br> 
Shallow Pond Lake supports a relatively diverse fish community.  Other species captured include bluegill, black bullhead, black chin shiner, bowfin, brown bullhead, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, and white sucker.  <br> 
 <br> 
The protection of water quality and habitat is critical in maintaining or improving fish and wildlife populations.  Unfortunately, human activities often negatively impact our lakes.  Fertilized turf-grass lawns and failing septic systems along with the removal of shoreline and aquatic vegetation, mowing to the shore, and installing sand blanket beaches result in destabilized shorelines, uncontrolled erosion, and increased run-off, contributing excess nutrients and sediment to the lake and degrading water quality and habitat.  By understanding the cumulative impacts of our actions and taking steps to avoid or minimize them, we can help insure our quality water resources can be enjoyed well into the future. Anglers can further help insure quality fishing by practicing selective harvest and catch and release.   <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2011-08-15',  County Name = 'Itasca', Lake Name = 'Shamrock' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/15/2011 Clarity: 14' 
 Narrative = '<p>Shamrock Lake is a 59-acre lake located 5 miles northwest of Taconite, MN.  The lake is the middle lake in a chain of three connected lakes including O'Reilly and Island Lake.  The lake is moderately developed and has clear water with a Secchi disk reading of 14 ft.  Previous water chemistry sampling indicated low fertility which negatively affects growth rates and abundance of the fishery.  Primary fish species include northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.   <br> 
 <br> 
The northern pike gill net catch rate was 5.0/net and was equal to the average catch rate for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have varied from 2.0 to 7.0/net.  Size structure was good for fish up to 26 inches; however no larger fish were sampled.  Five year classes of northern pike were sampled and growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 24 inches by age 6.   <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth bass were sampled by spring electrofishing and sampled 14 fish for a catch rate of 42.0/h, indicating a moderate population.  This was the first assessment to sample largemouth bass by electrofishing.  Three fish were sampled by gill nets or trap nets.  Size structure was moderate with fish up to 14 inches sampled.  Growth was slightly slower than the statewide average with fish averaging 14 inches by age 6.  Growth and size structure were similar to previous assessments. <br> 
 <br> 
The bluegill catch rate was 3.7/trap net and was lower than the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates have generally been low varying from 3.8 to 10.8/net in past assessments.  Size structure was poor with no fish larger than 7 inches sampled.  Growth was slower than the lake class average with fish only averaging 5.9 inches by age 8.  Bluegill rarely live beyond age 10 and since growth in Shamrock Lake is slow it is unlikely that the lake can produce many bluegill larger than 8 inches.   <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie catch rates were low, with catch rates of 0.3 and 1.3/net for gill nets and trap nets.  Catch rates in past assessments have varied from 0 to 5.7/gill net.  Size structure was poor with no fish larger than 9 inches sampled.  Growth was slow with fish only reaching 7.1 inches at age 5 compared to 9.5 inches for the statewide average.   <br> 
 <br> 
Common prey species such as yellow perch and tullibee were not abundant in Shamrock Lake.  No yellow perch were sampled in this assessment and they have only been sampled in gill nets once in six assessments.  Tullibee catch rate was 2.3/gill net which was between the first quartile and median of 1.0 and 3.0/gill net.  Tullibee catch rates in past assessments have been 4.0/ gill net or less in the last four assessments.  Low abundance of prey species limits growth rates and abundance of predator species such as northern pike. <br> 
 <br> 
Other species sampled by gill nets and trap nets include pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, yellow bullhead and white sucker.   <br> 
 <br> 
Lakeshore owners may affect fish populations not only through harvesting fish, but also through land use practices.  It is important to leave a 30 to 50 ft buffer strip of native vegetation along the shoreline to prevent erosion and provide habitat for fish and wildlife.  Nonfunctioning septic systems can also lead to water quality problems.  Good water quality and fish populations are the direct result of good land use practices.  Anglers can also help to improve the size structure of the fish community by harvesting fewer smaller fish and releasing medium and larger fish. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2013-08-26',  County Name = 'Itasca', Lake Name = 'Snowball' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/04/2013 Clarity: 18' 
 Narrative = '<p>Background <br> 
 <br> 
Snowball Lake is a 146-acre lake located one mile east of Calumet, MN.  Approximately 30% of the surface area is littoral (<15 feet) and the maximum depth is 38 feet.  The lake is moderately fertile.  The shoreline is lightly developed and Essar Steel has recently bought much of the north and east shorelines as part of their expanded mining operation.  The lake has an outlet, which drains to the Swan River just west of Swan Lake.  Fishing pressure is considered moderate.   <br> 
 <br> 
The lake management plan (LMP) was last revised in 2004.  Walleye and black crappie were the primary management species.  Goals of the LMP were to increase walleye gill net catch rates to 2.5 per net and maintain black crappie trap net catch rates above 3.4 per net.   A population assessment was conducted in 2013 to evaluate the success of walleye stocking and to determine the status of the fish community.  This assessment consisted of 6 gill nets and 9 trap nets.   <br> 
 <br> 
Results <br> 
 <br> 
Lakes with similar habitats rarely produce large walleye catches, and Snowball Lake has a history of low walleye catches.  Only five walleye were sampled in 2013.  The catch was lower than when compared to lakes with similar habitats and did not meet the management plan goal.  Walleye were recently stocked at one pound/littoral acre (43 pounds) in 2009 and 2004, but the success of stocking is not clear.  It is unlikely that Snowball Lake can produce a quality walleye fishery, given the characteristics of the lake, current fish community, and poor prey base. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike catches have increased with time.  The 2013 catch rate was higher than expected when compared to similar lakes, and the second highest ever sampled for Snowball Lake.  Increased pike abundance is not desirable in Snowball Lake.  Northern pike populations typically exhibit density dependent growth.  Average size and growth are typically poor when northern pike occur at high densities.  Size structure was poor as most of the sampled fish were between 16 to 18 inches in length.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 26.4 inches by age 6.  Anglers can help improve the size structure by releasing pike exceeding 24 inches. <br> 
Snowball Lake generally produces low yellow perch catches.   <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch catch rate in 2013 was lower than expected compared to similar lakes.  Yellow perch are an important prey species and catch rates will likely remain low as long as northern pike catch rates remain high. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill catch rates in past assessments have generally been low to moderate.  Bluegill trap net catch in 2013 was typical for lakes with similar habitats.    Size structure was poor as only two sampled fish exceeded 8 inches.  Similar lakes typically produce slow growing bluegill.  Bluegill from Snowball averaged 7.3 inches at age 6.  No fish older than age 7 were sampled.  Poor size structure likely limits the popularity of the fishery. <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie populations often exhibit irregular recruitment resulting in dominant year classes, shifting age and size structures, and inconsistent angler success.  Catch rates from Snowball Lake have been highly variable.  Black crappie catch rates were lower than expected in 2013, as only four fish were sampled between both gears.  All four crappie sampled in the 2013 assessment were from the same 2009 year class, indicating inconsistent recruitment.   <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth bass were also sampled in this survey.  Since largemouth bass are difficult to sample with standard survey gear during summer months, catch rates may not represent an accurate reflection of largemouth bass population.  Largemouth bass are likely an important component of the fishery. <br> 
Several other fish species were sampled in relatively low abundance and included brown and yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, white sucker, and bowfin. <br> 
 <br> 
Snowball Lake does not appear to currently contain invasive species.  Anglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.    <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2008-07-28',  County Name = 'Itasca', Lake Name = 'Split Hand' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/28/2008 Clarity: 3.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Splithand Lake is a moderately sized, eutrophic lake in southern Itasca County near Grand Rapids.  The lake is highly fertile and has poor water clarity much of the year.  Much of the shoreline is in a natural state consisting primarily of forest and secondarily of wetland.  Approximately 35% of the shoreline has been residentially developed and the remaining shoreline is undisturbed.  Splithand Lake is situated in the Mississippi River/ Splithand Lake minor watershed and has three inlets.  There is a connection to Little Splithand Lake and the Mississippi River via the outlet, Splithand Creek. <br> 
 <br> 
A diverse aquatic plant community is a major attribute of Splithand Lake, providing valuable habitat for a variety of fish species.  Submergent plants were widespread, but limited to depths of 5 feet or less.  Flatstem, variable, claspingleaf, and narrow leaf pondweeds were the most widespread submergent plants and occurred in over 50% of transects.  Floating leaf and emergent vegetation are especially beneficial as they provide important over-head cover for fish and a buffer to wave action, thus protecting the shoreline from erosion.  Yellow waterlily was the most common floating leaf species and occurred in 93% of transects.  Emergent vegetation was also widespread, occurring in most transects.  Hardstem bulrush, giant burreed, and arrowhead (Sagittaria spp) were the most widespread emergent species and occurred around much of the lake.  Sixteen terrestrial species were found on the shoreline with exotic reed canary being the most widespread, occurring in 53% of transects.  Jewelweed and cane were also widespread around the lakeshore.   <br> 
 <br> 
Splithand Lake supports a relatively diverse fish community, providing angling opportunities for several species.  Yellow perch was the most common species captured in gill nets and were caught in high numbers compared to similar lakes.  Yellow perch have historically been abundant in Splithand Lake. The size structure was generally poor, however, as few individuals exceeded 8 inches.  Growth was average and individuals typically exceeded 8 inches by age 5.  Given the size structure and relative abundance, yellow perch appear to be a very important prey species in Splithand Lake. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye were sampled in average numbers in 2008.  The gill net catch was typical for Splithand Lake and other similar lakes.  In 2008, size structure was favorable and individuals averaged 15 inches.  The largest fish sampled exceeded 26 inches.  Growth was average and individuals typically exceeded 15 inches by age 5.  Forty-four percent of the sample exceeded age 5 suggesting a favorable age distribution.  Recruitment appeared variable as the 2006 and 2002 year classes made up 31% and 21% of the sample.  Stocking was conducted four times between 1998 and 2008, (1998, 2000, 2003, 2006).  Forty-nine percent of the sampled walleye corresponded to stocked years, suggesting natural reproduction contributes greatly to the population as seen in the strong 2002 year class.   <br> 
 <br> 
A special walleye regulation requiring the release of all walleye from 17 to 26 inches was enacted in 2005.  Initial results are encouraging as the proportion of walleye over 17 inches increased dramatically from 2002 when very few fish exceeded 17 inches.  Given the regulation, the size and age structures should remain favorable, providing good angling opportunities into the future. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike were sampled in average numbers in 2008.  The gill net catch was about average compared to similar lakes.  Size structure was moderate as most fish exceeded 21 inches.  Few individuals over 28 inches were present, however.  The largest pike sampled was 32 inches.  Growth was average and individuals typically exceeded 21 inches by age 4.  Age distribution was moderate as 70% of the sample exceeded age 4.  Few fish exceeded age 6, however, contributing to the lack of preferred sized individuals.  Given the lack of preferred sized individuals, the popularity of the pike fishery may be limited.  Anglers should consider releasing pike over 22 inches to improve the age and size structures. <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie were captured in typical numbers for Splithand Lake.  Most individuals in the gill nets were relatively small.  The trap nets indicated a favorable size distribution, however, capturing fish from 8 to 12 inches.  Age analysis identified 7 year classes, although reproduction and/or recruitment appeared inconsistent as the 2007 and 2004 year classes represented most of the sample.  Growth was average with individuals typically exceeding 8 inches by age 4.  Only 29% of the sampled fish exceeded age-4, however, suggesting high mortality of older individuals.  Splithand Lake supports a popular winter fishery and harvest likely contributed to the age and size structures.   <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill were captured in low numbers.  Splithand has a history of low bluegill catches.  Size structure was relatively good, however, as most individuals exceed 6 inches and individuals exceeding 8 inches were present.  Growth was fast, with individuals exceeding 6 inches by age 5.  Individuals exceeding age 5 dominate the age distribution (80%), suggesting limited reproduction and recruitment in recent years.  Given the age and size distribution, some interest may exist in the bluegill fishery. <br> 
 <br> 
Test net sampling often inadequately samples largemouth bass.  Largemouth bass were therefore sampled using night boat electrofishing in June.  Largemouth bass were captured in moderate numbers.  Size structure was good as most individuals exceeded 12 inches and fish over 15 inches were relatively common.  Growth was average.  Individuals typically exceeded 12 inches by age 5.  The age distribution appeared balanced as 58% of the sampled individuals exceeded age-5.  Good angling opportunities should exist. <br> 
 <br> 
Tullibee were captured in relatively low numbers.  Tullibee are an important prey species that are often associated with the production of large predators including northern pike and walleye.  Reductions in the tullibee population could result in reduced pike and walleye production and limit growth and size structure. <br> 
 <br> 
Other species captured include bowfin, shorthead redhorse, white sucker, bigmouth buffalo, brown bullhead, common shiner, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, yellow bullhead, Iowa darter, blacknose shiner, brook silverside, banded killifish, golden shiner, spottail shiner, and tadpole madtom. <br> 
	 <br> 
Natural shoreline characteristics and a diverse plant community are major attributes of Splithand Lake. The protection of water quality and habitat is critical in maintaining or improving fish and wildlife populations.  Unfortunately, human activities often negatively impact lakes.  Fertilized turf-grass lawns and failing septic systems along with the removal of shoreline and aquatic vegetation, mowing to the shore, and installing sand blanket beaches results in destabilized shorelines, uncontrolled erosion, and increased run-off, contributing excess nutrients and sediment to the lake and degrading water quality and habitat.  By understanding the cumulative impacts of our actions and taking steps to avoid or minimize them, we can help insure our quality water resources can be enjoyed well into the future.

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2012-06-11',  County Name = 'Itasca', Lake Name = 'Three Island' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/12/2012 Clarity: 23' 
 Narrative = '<p>Three Island Lake is a 235-acre lake located 5 miles east of Marcell, MN.  The lake is moderately developed and has very clear water with a Secchi disk reading of 23 ft.  Three Island Lake is deep with a maximum depth of 66 ft and is accessible by a portage trail from Crooked Lake.  Previous water chemistry indicated low fertility which impacts the fishery through slow growth and reduced abundance.  Primary fish species include smallmouth and largemouth bass, northern pike and panfish.   <br> 
 <br> 
Smallmouth and largemouth bass were sampled by night electrofishing in early June.  Three Island Lake historically has a high density smallmouth bass population with quality fish.  The catch rate in 2012 was 121.9/hour and was similar to past assessments which varied from 65 to 120/hour.  Size structure was good with fish up to 20 inches sampled.  Growth was slow with fish averaging 13.5 inches by age six compared to 20.5 inches at age six for the statewide average.  Although growth was slow, fish up to age 12 were sampled.  Despite slow growth, smallmouth in Three Island Lake live long enough to attain a large size.  Anglers can help maintain the quality smallmouth bass population by releasing larger fish because it can take 10 years or longer to grow a 20 inch fish. <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth bass were less abundant and had an electrofishing catch rate of 4.5/hour and was similar to past assessments.  Size structure was good with fish up to 17 inches sampled.  Growth was also slow with fish averaging 13.5 inches at age six compared to 15.1 inches for the statewide average.   <br> 
 <br> 
The northern pike gill net catch rate was 3.0/net and was at the lower end of the expected range for similar lakes.  Northern pike were not sampled in the first two assessments in 1968 and 1974 and catch rates in assessments since then have varied from 4.0 to 8.6/gill net.  Size structure in 2012 was moderate with fish up to 30 inches sampled.  Previous assessments had sampled fish up to 39 inches.  Growth was faster than the statewide average to age seven and slower than the average to age nine.   <br> 
 <br> 
The bluegill catch rate was 4.7/trap net and was lower than the expected range for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have been variable from 3.0 to 37.5/trap net.  Size structure was poor with only two fish sampled larger than 8 inches.  Size structure has also been poor in past assessments, likely due to the low fertility of the lake. <br> 
 <br> 
Three walleye were sampled for a catch rate of 0.5/gill net which was below the expected range.  Walleye catch rates have generally been low and walleye were not sampled in the first two assessments in 1968 and 1974.  Walleye have not been stocked and the population is maintained through natural reproduction.  Yellow perch are an important prey species for walleye and their low catch rates likely limits the walleye population. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch catch rates have been less than 1/gill net in all assessments except in 1982 when the catch rate was 10.8/net.  Only one yellow perch was sampled by trap nets in 2012.  Low yellow perch catch rates likely limits the population of walleye and northern pike. <br> 
 <br> 
Three Island Lake has a fairly simple fish community and white sucker was the only other species sampled.  Because Three Island Lake is a small, deep and fairly sterile, net catches are generally light.  In 2012, six gill nets sampled a total of 45 fish and trap nets sampled 52 fish. <br>

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/12/2013 Clarity: 17' 
 Narrative = '<p>Trout Lake is a large, fertile, class 22 lake located immediately south of Coleraine, Minnesota.  As a result of industrial and municipal practices within the watershed, the lake has experienced tremendous changes in water quality and the fish community.  In recent years, the lake has provided a quality northern pike and walleye fishery.  The 2011 lake management plan indicates walleye and northern pike as the primary species of management with black crappie, largemouth bass and smallmouth bass as secondary species.  In 2005, a 17 to 26 inch protected slot length limit with only one fish over 26 inches in possession was implemented for walleye.  The 2013 assessment included additional sampling of near shore fish species in order to calculate an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score and these data are documented in a separate report. <br> 
 <br> 
The 2011 management plan indicates the goal for walleye is to maintain a gill net catch of 10 fish/net.  The walleye gill-net catch rate was 9.9 fish/net in 2007, declined to 5.3 fish/net in 2010, and increased to 10.8 fish/net in 2013.  The record high walleye catch in 2013 following the lowest catch in recent history (2010) provides an excellent example of the dynamic nature of fish populations.  The sampled fish ranged from 7.9 to 25.8 inches and averaged 17.2 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
The 2013 assessment evaluated a period in which walleye were stocked in 1999-2001, 2003-04, 2007-08, and 2011-12.  Although natural reproduction has been well documented on Trout Lake, the larger year-classes corresponded to stocked years in this assessment.  Twelve year-classes were identified by scale, opercle and otolith analysis.  Walleye averaged 14.2 inches at age 3, which was the same as in 2007.  The slower growth observed in 2010 was likely in response to the two shorter and cooler growing seasons of 2008 and 2009.  Growth has continued to be similar to the statewide averages. <br> 
 <br> 
The management plan goal for northern pike was to maintain a gill-net catch of 3.0 fish/net.  Northern pike gill net catch rates have varied from 1.0 to 9.3 fish/net since 1946.  Following the lowest catch on record (1.0 fish/net) in 2007, the catch improved to 2.5 and 2.9 fish/net in 2010 and 2013.  Northern pike ranged from 19.2 to 31.3 inches and averaged 24.5 inches.  For two consecutive assessments, only four age-classes were identified by scales and cliethra.  The sampled fish ranged from age 2 to age 5.  The age structure appears to indicate there is low but consistent recruitment.  Fast growth, early maturation, and no older fish in two consecutive assessments may be an indication of angler over-harvest and should be monitored closely. <br> 
  <br> 
Black crappie are not sampled effectively in many lakes due to their behavior of suspending off the bottom away from shallow cover during the summer.  The low population appears to be in response to the lake only having a few shallow, protected bays that are important for recruitment.  The normal range for this lake class is 0.2 to 1.1 fish/gill net and 0.3 to 1.7 fish/trap net.  The trap nets captured seven fish for a catch of 0.5 fish/net.  Gill nets only sampled three fish for a catch rate of 0.2 fish/net compared to 0.1 fish/net in 2010.  The fish that were sampled ranged from 4.5 to 13.2 inches.  Age and growth information was not collected in this assessment. <br> 
 <br> 
Tullibees are difficult to sample with our standard summer gear due to their pelagic nature.  As a result, tullibee catch rates are generally low but they can be highly variable.  In 1946, the gill net catch rate was 23.3 fish/net and since that time catch rates have never been higher than 3.8 (1989).  The decline may be a result of changes in water quality due to the land use practices within the watershed.  In the last two assessments, the gill-net catch rate was 0.1 fish/net. <br> 
 <br> 
The yellow perch population has experienced major fluctuations over the years.  The gill net catch rates increased from 20.3 in 1984 to 169.3 in 1999 over five assessments, then declined substantially to 28.6 fish/net in 2004.  The catch of 52.4 fish/net in 2013 rebounded from the record low of 13.9 fish/net in 2010.  Yellow perch lengths ranged from 4.3 to 9.9 inches and averaged 6.8 inches.  Due to the yellow perch size structure, they are probably more important within the fish community as a competitor and prey source than as a species desired by anglers. <br> 
 <br> 
Other species observed during the assessment included bowfin, brown bullhead, common shiner, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, smallmouth bass, white sucker, and yellow bullhead. <br> 
 <br> 
In order to maintain or improve fish and wildlife populations, water quality and habitat must be protected.  People often associate water quality problems with large-scale agricultural, forestry, urban development or industrial practices in the watershed.  In reality, the impact of land use decisions on one lake lot may be relatively small, yet the cumulative impact of those decisions on many lake lots can result in a significant decline in water quality and habitat.  For example, removing shoreline and aquatic vegetation, fertilizing lawns, mowing to the water's edge, installing beach sand blankets, failing septic systems and uncontrolled run-off, all contribute excess nutrients and sediment which degrade water quality and habitat.  Understanding these cumulative impacts and taking steps to avoid or minimize them will help to insure our quality fisheries can be enjoyed by future generations.</p>'

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2015-10-05',  County Name = 'Itasca', Lake Name = 'Unnamed' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/27/2015 Clarity: 11' 
 Narrative = '<p>Background <br> 
 <br> 
Nickel Lake is a 13.2 acre natural lake in northern Itasca County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 36.5 feet and clear water with a Secchi disk transparency of 18 feet.  Nickel Lake has very soft, infertile water, which limits fish production.   Nickel Lake has no inlets or outlets.   Temperature and dissolved oxygen measurements from several profiles have determined that suitable conditions exist for stream trout management.   <br> 
 <br> 
Nickel Lake has a long history of stream trout management and the presence of non-trout species in the lake has limited past success of the fishery.  The lake was first stocked with Rainbow Trout in 1938, although natural populations of bass, sunfish, perch, and white suckers already existed.  The lake was designated as a stream trout lake in 1955 and reclaimed with rotenone to remove the native fish species.   Rainbow Trout fingerlings were stocked following the reclamation to establish a stream trout fishery.  The 1972 and 1974 assessment nettings were the first netting efforts conducted after the 1955 reclamation.  Both assessments captured other fish species including suckers and Largemouth Bass that compete with trout.  The lake was reclaimed again in August 1982 using rotenone and Brook Trout were stocked the following spring.  The lake remained relatively void of non-trout species for several years.  The 2004 assessment resulted in a relatively high catch of Golden Shiners, which had probably been introduced via a bait bucket.  Anglers reported catching bluegill in 2009 and Bluegill were caught in large numbers in the 2010 and 2015 assessments, indicating that a population had become established.  Largemouth Bass were sampled in 2015.  <br> 
The lake was stocked annually with either Rainbow or Brook Trout, or both from 1955 to 1987. Rainbow Trout were stocked annually from 1988 to 2003.  Yearling Brown Trout were stocked in the fall of 2004 to utilize the golden shiners as prey and hopefully reduce shiner abundance.   Rainbow Trout and Brown Trout were stocked in alternate years from 2004-2009.  Since 2010, only Brown Trout have been stocked annually. <br> 
 <br> 
The lake management plan for Nickel Lake was revised in 2011. The long range goals of the plan were to maintain a put, grow, and take stream trout fishery capable of consistently providing anglers with stock sized rainbow and Brown Trout (10 inches) with sufficient growth and survival that 20% of the fish exceed 15 inches and occasionally some fish will attain and exceed 18 inches. Fall trap net catch rates should exceed 1.0 trout per net. <br> 
 <br> 
Assessment Results <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegills remained the most common fish in both the gill net and trap net samples.  Bluegill ranged from 1.7 to 7.8 inches with an average length of 5.2 inches in 2015.  Size quality was poor and similar to the previous assessment.  Lakes with similar habitats produce slow growing sunfish and Bluegills are not expected to grow large in Nickel Lake.  Several year classes were present and growth was near the lake class average as Bluegill averaged 6.0 inches by age 6.  The presence of Bluegill is expected to greatly limit trout production in the future. <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth Bass were sampled for the first time since the previous reclamation in 2015, occurring in both the gill net and trap net sample.  Bass were generally small, as length ranged from 3.2 to 13.6 inches and averaged 9.6 inches.  Three year classes were present, suggesting that natural reproduction had occurred.  Growth was near the statewide average with bass averaging 12.9 inches by age 5. <br> 
 <br> 
Only six Brown Trout were captured at a rate of 1.0/gill net and 0.3/trap net, failing to meet the long range goal of the lake management plan.  Brown Trout lengths varied from 9.8 to 18.3 inches.  Length distribution suggests that the fish were from two stockings.   <br> 
 <br> 
Golden shiners were captured at a rate of 3.5/ gill net.  A previous assessment in 2004 captured golden shiners at a rate of 18.8/trap net.  It appears that the introduction of Brown Trout and Largemouth Bass may have negatively influenced golden shiner abundance. <br> 
 <br> 
The catch rate goals of the lake management plan were not met.  The introduction of Bluegill and Largemouth Bass has likely resulted in poor survival of stocked trout.  Future management may include discontinuing trout management on Nickel Lake altogether, or conducting an expensive reclamation to remove the non-salmonid fish.  Anglers should be reminded that it is unlawful to use live bait in designated trout waters and illegal to stock fish into public waters without a DNR permit.  Illegal fish stockings, even when done with good intentions, often have unforeseen and detrimental consequences on the fish community and future angling success. <br>

 Survey Date = '2014-08-25',  County Name = 'Itasca', Lake Name = 'Upper Panasa' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/25/2014 Clarity: 3.8' 
 Narrative = '<p>Upper Panasa Lake is a small, eutrophic lake located one mile south of Calumet, Minnesota in the Mississippi River watershed.  The lake has a total surface area of 174 acres and a maximum depth of 13 feet.  Water clarity has been poor, as Secchi disk transparency has ranged from 1.5 to 4.5 ft.  The inlets originate from Mud Lake, a swamp drainage, and from a sewage treatment plant.  The outlet, Upper Panasa Creek, flows into Lower Panasa Lake.  The lake has a limited plant community due to poor water clarity and the shorelines have been disturbed by past mining activity.   <br> 
 <br> 
The lake management plan was last revised in 2002.  Northern Pike were the primary management species and Black Crappie and Walleye were secondary management species.  The goals of the lake management plan were to maintain the Northern Pike gill net catch rate at 7.0 fish/net and maintain the Black Crappie trap net catch at 2.1 fish/net or gill-net catch at 2.5 fish/net.   <br> 
 <br> 
A population assessment was conducted in August of 2014 to assess the status of the fish community.  This assessment consisted of 3 gill net sets and 9 trap net sets. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch were the most commonly captured fish and the gill net catch was high compared to similar lakes and was the highest catch reported for the lake.  Perch were generally too small to interest anglers, as length ranged from 5.3 to 10.4 inches and averaged 6.4 inches.  Four year classes were present (2-5) and growth was near the statewide average with individuals exceeding 7 inches in five years. <br> 
 <br> 
Upper Panasa Lake has a history of high Black Bullhead catches.  Black Bullhead were common in 2014 as the gill net catch was high compared to similar lakes.   Size structure was poor, as Bullhead ranged from 5.0 to 10.3 inches and averaged 7.9 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike were the primary gamefish present and the catch was typical for the lake class and similar to past catches on Upper Panasa.  This catch met the lake management plan goal set in 2002.  Size structure was moderate as Pike ranged from 18.2 to 27.2 inches and averaged 23.6 inches.  Age analysis identified 5 year classes (1-5) and growth was fast as Pike exceeded 24 inches by age 4.   <br> 
 <br> 
Other species present include Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead.  The fish community was representative of a lake with occasional winterkill events.  No fish were estimated to be older than age 5, and no Walleye or Black Crappie were captured, suggesting winterkill in the recent past.  The winter of 2008/2009 included several heavy late winter snowfalls and a later than normal ice out date.  It is likely that a winterkill event took place and the fish community is still in recovery.    <br> 
 <br> 
Upper Panasa Lake supports invasive Chinese Mystery snails.  Anglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.    <br>

 <br> 
Flaherty Lake is a 450-acre lake located four miles north of the City of Lakefield in Jackson County.  Flaherty Lake has a maximum depth of 5.0 feet, and typically has turbid water.  Flaherty Lake is located in a predominantly agricultural landscape, which likely accounts for the poor water quality.  Flaherty Lake has one major inlet, which includes County Ditch 118 and Judicial Ditch 53, draining approximately five square miles.  Flaherty Lake outlets into a private ditch at the southwest corner of the lake, then flows approximately 1.5 miles downstream into South Heron Lake.  Despite a 30 foot drop in elevation from Flaherty Lake to South Heron Lake, fish are able to emigrate from South Heron Lake when water is high.  Up until this point, Flaherty Lake did not have a public access and therefore was not stocked or managed by MNDNR Fisheries.  In 2015, land was purchased on the east side of the lake by the Jackson County Conservation League, and an access was installed by MNDNR during the summer of 2015.  Historically, Flaherty Lake has provided good Yellow Perch and Northern Pike fishing; therefore, the lake will likely be managed primarily for Northern Pike and secondarily for Yellow Perch. Additionally, Flaherty Lake occasionally experiences low dissolved oxygen levels, thus management species will include those that are more tolerant of low dissolved oxygen levels such as Northern Pike and Yellow Perch.  An initial survey was conducted the week of June 29, 2015 to document size and abundance of existing fish populations using one gill net and nine trap nets.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
NORTHERN PIKE  <br> 
 <br> 
Zero Northern Pike were captured in the 2015 survey.  Historically, Flaherty Lake has had a fishable Northern Pike population that at times was fairly abundant. A special fish survey in 2000 captured 17.0 Northern Pike per trap net.  The winter of 2013-2014 proved to be harsh as thick ice and snow resulted in low dissolved oxygen levels in many area lakes.  Although dissolved oxygen was not monitored and no reports of dead fish were received, Flaherty Lake likely experienced some winterkill during the winter of 2013-2014, which may account for no Northern Pike being captured in 2015.  The Northern Pike population will be reestablished via stocking.  Stocking has already begun, as 464 Northern Pike fingerlings (4 fish per pound) were stocked in September 2015.  Depending on availability, adult winter rescue Northern Pike from Rice Lake in Aitkin County will be stocked during the winter of 2015-2016.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
YELLOW PERCH <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch were abundant in 2015, being captured at a rate of 69.0 per gill net, which is higher than the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (3.3 to 30.4 per gill net).  Size structure of Yellow Perch was small, as Yellow Perch were 4.8 to 10.0 inches and averaged 6.2 inches.  The reestablishment of Northern Pike in Flaherty Lake should provide balance to the Yellow Perch population, by reducing abundance and encouraging growth of Yellow Perch.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
OTHER SPECIES <br> 
 <br> 
Evidence from years past suggested that Black Bullhead were very abundant in Flaherty Lake.  In 2015, Black Bullhead were captured at a rate of 73.0 per gill net which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (30.3 to 150.6 per gill net).  Black Bullhead were 4.8 to 12.8 inches and averaged 8.6 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Bigmouth Buffalo were captured at a rate of 9.0 per gill net, which is higher than the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area 0.8 to 7.0 per gill net).  Bigmouth Buffalo were 8.8 to 16.9 inches and averaged 12.7 inches.   <br> 
 <br> 
Common Carp were captured at a rate of 2.8 per trap net, which was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (1.0 to 5.5 per trap net).  Common Carp were large, with lengths ranging from 7.6 to 30.8 inches and averaging 24.1 inches.  <br> 
One 22.3 inch Walleye was captured in the gill net.  Walleye have not been stocked since 1999 (private stocking), so this was likely an illegal introduction. Twelve White Sucker were sampled, ranging in length from 7.9 to 17.7 inches and averaging 12.3 inches. Twenty-three Orangespotted Sunfish were sampled. <br> 
 <br> 
Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> 
 <br> 
Best management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality.  Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br>

 Survey Date = '2015-06-15',  County Name = 'Jackson', Lake Name = 'Independence' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/15/2015 Clarity: 6.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>INTRODUCTION <br> 
 <br> 
Independence Lake is a 112-acre lake located seven miles southeast of the City of Windom in Jackson County.  The lake's shallow depth (maximum of 10 feet) and improved water clarity in recent years have encouraged the growth of dense aquatic vegetation (mainly curly-leaf pondweed, which is an exotic species and coontail) throughout the lake.  There was also some bulrush present in a couple of locations on the perimeter of the lake.  The vegetation growth has benefitted the fishery by providing habitat for several species of fish.  Independence Lake has historically been vulnerable to low oxygen levels during the winter, which have resulted in occasional winterkill of fish; however, this has not occurred in recent years.  Because of the threat of winterkill, the Jackson County Conservation League operates a Helixor aeration system in Independence Lake.  Independence Lake is managed primarily for Largemouth Bass and secondarily for Bluegill and Walleye.  Largemouth Bass fingerlings were stocked in 2013; however, Largemouth Bass mostly maintain themselves through natural reproduction.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked two out of three years and have been stocked extensively in the last decade (2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2013, and 2014).  Independence Lake was surveyed the week of June 15, 2015 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and nine trap nets.   <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
LARGEMOUTH BASS <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth Bass were captured at a rate of 656.5 per hour, which is the highest recorded catch rate on Independence Lake.  Catch rates in previous years had been stable, ranging from 22.7 per hour in 2007 to around 47.0 per hour in 1999 and 2011.  Largemouth Bass were 3.6 to 19.0 inches and averaged 6.2 inches. Average length was small because 82 percent of the bass sampled were less than 5.4 inches; however, good numbers of fish from 15.0 to 19.0 inches were present.  Largemouth Bass were plump, indicating that plenty of food is available.  The wide range of lengths indicated that this is a balanced population that should provide good fishing in an area where bass fishing opportunities are scarce.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
WALLEYE <br> 
 <br> 
Gill net catch rates of Walleye in Independence Lake have varied from 0.0 per gill net in 2007 to 15.0 per gill net in 1999, and have averaged 5.9 per gill net since 1985.  In 2015, Walleye were captured at a rate of 8.0 per gill net, which was about the same as the 2011 catch rate of 7.7 per gill net, and was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (2.3 to 13.3 per gill net.  Walleye were 12.1 to 24.3 inches long and averaged 16.3 inches.  Four year classes of Walleye were sampled including fish from 2013 (age-2), 2012 (age-3), 2011 (age-4), and 2008 (age-7), all of which correspond to stocking events.  Fingerlings were not stocked in 2012, but yearlings from Carey Lake (1.6 fish per pound) were stocked in the fall 2013, which accounts for the 2012 year class. The 2013 year class was the most abundant, accounting for 61 percent of the Walleye sampled.  Growth of Walleye was good as they reached 16.2 inches at age-3.  Walleye were plump, suggesting that they are readily feeding on the abundant Yellow Perch population.  Fingerling stocking appears to be providing a stable Walleye population with a decent number of fish, good size structure, and good growth.  Independence Lake should be a good walleye angling destination right now and in the future.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
BLUEGILL and PUMPKINSEED <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill catch rates have steadily declined since 1999, going from 78.0 per trap net in 1999 to 13.0 per trap net in 2003 to 1.9 per trap net in 2007 to 0.4 per trap net in 2011 to 0.0 per trap net in 2015.  However, the decline in Bluegill numbers is likely related to the increase in Pumpkinseed (28.2 per trap net) and Yellow Perch (167.7 per gill net) numbers.  The three species often occupy similar habitats and eat similar foods thereby competing with each other for resources.   Oftentimes, Bluegill and Pumpkinseed hybridize, resulting in fewer "pure strain" Bluegill.  Pumpkinseed were first sampled in 2003 at a rate of 4.2 per trap net and since have declined to 3.7 per trap net in 2007 to 1.6 per trap net in 2011, and then drastically increased to 28.2 per trap net in 2015.  Pumpkinseed were 4.0 to 8.7 inches and averaged 5.1 inches.  Pumpkinseed less than 6.0 inches accounted for 99 percent of the sample, as only two over 6.0 inches were captured.  With an additional year or two of growth, the Pumpkinseed should reach a size that anglers can harvest.   <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
YELLOW PERCH <br> 
 <br> 
In the last decade, Yellow Perch abundance has increased from 25.5 per gill net in 2007 to 67.7 per gill net in 2011 to a record high of 167.7 per gill net in 2015.  Yellow Perch were 6.5 to 8.7 inches and averaged 7.7 inches.  With an additional year or two of growth, Yellow Perch should be approaching a size that anglers are willing to harvest.  Yellow perch fishing should be phenomenal in the next couple of years at Independence Lake.  No doubt this would be a great destination for young anglers learning to fish as action for Yellow Perch, small Largemouth, and/or Pumpkinseed is likely to provide hours of entertainment outdoors.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
BLACK BULLHEAD <br> 
 <br> 
Black Bullhead catch rates in gill nets (7.0 per gill net) and trap nets (3.6 per trap net) were the lowest recorded catch rates for Independence Lake since surveys began in 1985. Both catch rates were below their expected ranges of catch rates for similar lakes (30.3 to 150.6 per gill net; 11.5 to 132.6 per trap net).  Black Bullhead were 10.4 to 12.3 inches and averaged 11.2 inches.  The decline in Black Bullhead abundance may be attributed to stable predator populations of Largemouth Bass and Walleye.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
OTHER SPECIES <br> 
 <br> 
Two Black Crappies, both 5.1 inches in length, were captured in the 2015 survey.  Black Crappie have historically occurred at very low abundances in Independence Lake.  Independence Lake is unique, in that Common Carp, Bigmouth Buffalo, and Channel Catfish have never been sampled there.  This is due in part to the fact that Lake Independence does not have a good connection downstream thus making fish immigration difficult if not impossible.  To avoid unintended introductions, anglers should be diligent about disposing of unused bait in the trash and should report unpermitted movement of fish. <br> 
 <br> 
Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> 
 <br> 
Best management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality.  Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br>

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/17/2016 Clarity: 2.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Little Spirit Lake is a 643-acre, class 42 lake located on the Minnesota-Iowa border in Jackson County.  Little Spirit Lake has a history of experiencing varying levels of winterkill and summer kill conditions due to low dissolved oxygen in the winter and severe algae blooms in the summer.  Thus, Little Spirit Lake is aerated by the Jackson County Conservation League to reduce winterkill frequency and/or severity.  In terms of invasive species, Little Spirit Lake is on the frontline, as Bighead and Silver Carp were sampled in Big Spirit Lake, which is hydrologically connected to Little Spirit Lake.  Additionally, Zebra Mussels are established in East and West Lake Okoboji, which are in close proximity to Big and Little Spirit Lakes.  Since the late 2000's, the Minnesota DNR has taken the lead on stocking Little Spirit Lake to prevent overstocking.  It is managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Yellow Perch. A natural reproduction evaluation using night electrofishing was conducted on September 28, 2016 to determine if natural reproduction occurred in 2016.  <br> 
 <br> 
Young-of-the year Walleye were captured at a rate of 37.3 per hour electrofishing, which indicates that some degree of natural reproduction occurred or they came from Big Spirit Lake.  Little Spirit Lake is connected to Big Spirit Lake in Iowa, which allows passage by small fish, so Walleye fry or fingerlings may have migrated from Big Spirit Lake as well.  The age-0 Walleyes ranged in length from 4.5 to 7.9 inches and averaged 6.5 inches. <br>

 Narrative = '<p>INTRODUCTION <br> 
 <br> 
Round Lake is a 1024-acre lake located in Jackson County approximately two miles to the northeast of the City of Round Lake.  Round Lake has a mean depth of 8.0 ft. and a maximum of 9.0ft; however, the water level in 2015 (1,521.6 ft.) was the second lowest recorded elevation in the last 27 years. The highest water level was observed in 1993 at 1523.82 ft., and the lowest recorded water level was observed in 1959 at 1519.45 ft.  There is no explanation for why the lake's current water level is so low, other than the Round Lake area has missed out on many local precipitation events.  Nutrient input into Round Lake is high, as its watershed is dominated by agriculture.  Aquatic vegetation is scarce as the turbid waters prevent its establishment and growth.  Prior to the installation of the aeration system, Round Lake was prone to winterkill, as it was opened to liberalized fishing ten times between 1945 and 1979.  An aeration system was installed in 1981 to prevent winterkill.  Round Lake has not experienced winterkill since its installation.  Walleye are the primary management species in Round Lake and have been stocked as fry three out of four years since 2008 (2012, 2013, 2014, 2016).  Secondary management species include Black Crappie, Channel Catfish, and Yellow Perch.  Secondary management species populations sustain themselves through natural reproduction, thus they haven't been stocked since the aeration system was installed.  Other sport fish present include Northern Pike, White Bass, and White Crappie.  A survey was conducted during the week of August 10, 2015 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and 12 trap nets.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
WALLEYE <br> 
 <br> 
Since the record catch rate of 152.5 per gill net in 2005, Walleye catch rates had steadily declined to 28.3 per gill net in 2009 and 7.7 per gill net in 2013.  The Walleye catch rate increased in 2015 to 16.3 per gill net, which is above the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (2.3 to 13.3 per gill net).  The increase in abundance is likely the result of a successful fry stocking in 2013, as over half of the Walleye sampled were age-2 (2013 year class).  Lengths of Walleye ranged from 6.5 to 25.8 inches and averaged 13.5 inches.  Five year classes of Walleye were sampled (2005, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015), all of which correspond to fry stocking, except the 2015 year class, which was not a stocked year and likely the result of natural reproduction.  Growth of Walleye in Round Lake was slow compared to similar lakes, as Walleye reached 14.3 inches by age-3.  The slower growth rate could be a result of a more abundant walleye population and thereby creating more competition for food.  Walleye angling should be good on Round Lake in the next couple of years.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
BLACK CRAPPIE <br> 
 <br> 
Black Crappie catch rates have steadily increased in gill nets and trap nets since 2009.  Gill net catch rates have increased from 1.3 per gill net in 2009 to 3.0 per gill net in 2013 to 4.3 per gill net in 2015, which is within the expected range of catch rats for similar lakes in the area (0.0 to 6.7 per gill net).  Trap net catch rates have increased from 1.3 per trap net in 2009 to 2.3 per trap net in 2013 to 3.4 per trap net in 2015, which is also within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (0.7 to 15.3 per trap net).  Black Crappie were 5.5 to 11.7 inches long and averaged 9.3 inches.  Black crappie numbers tend to be highly variable and is often characterized as cyclic, with strong year classes reoccurring every three to five years.  This variable and cyclic abundance often results in a "boom-or-bust" crappie fishery, where years of increased angler catch rates are followed by years of decreased angler catch rates.  Although catch rates of Black Crappie aren't high, there are still some available for anglers if they can find the right spot.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
CHANNEL CATFISH  <br> 
 <br> 
Channel Catfish catch rates have varied from 0.0 per gill net in 1994 to 19.5 per gill net in 2001, and have averaged 4.4 per gill net since 1983.  In 2015, Channel Catfish were captured at a rate of 6.0 per gill net, down from 7.0 per gill net in 2013, but still higher than the expected range of catch rates in similar lakes in the area (0.0 to 3.0 per gill net).  Channel Catfish were 18.6 to 30.3 inches long and averaged 21.6 inches.  The Channel Catfish population is self-supporting as they have not been stocked since 1981.  Channel Catfish angling at Round Lake should be good.   <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
YELLOW PERCH <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch catch rates have not exceeded 15.7 per gill net since 1988, and have usually been low. The 2015 catch rate of 1.7 per gill net was the same as the 2013 catch rate and was below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.3 to 30.4 per gill net).  Yellow Perch were 7.3 to 11.1 inches long and averaged 9.7 inches.  Yellow Perch populations tend to fluctuate depending on the abundance of predator populations such as Walleye, Channel Catfish, Northern Pike, and White Bass. These predators are likely controlling the Yellow Perch population in Round Lake. No Yellow Perch less than 7.0 inches were sampled, indicating that natural reproduction has been minimal in recent years.  Current low water levels likely reduce the amount of preferred spawning habitat available for adult Yellow Perch, thereby limiting reproduction.   <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
WHITE CRAPPIE <br> 
 <br> 
Although the Black Crappie numbers are lower, the White Crappie catch rate was 19.3 per gill net and 7.8 per trap net, which are the highest catch rates of White Crappie recorded in Round Lake.  Prior to 2015, White Crappie catch rates in gill nets did not exceed 0.3 per gillnet, and in trap nets did not exceed 0.3 per trap net.  Similar to Black Crappie, recruitment of White Crappie can be highly variable resulting in sporadic strong year classes, which is likely where these fish came from.  White Crappies were 7.4 to 12.1 inches long and averaged 9.1 inches.  The 8.0 to 9.5 inch White Crappies were the most abundant size.  White and Black Crappie can typically coexist, but it is not uncommon for one species to occur at a lower abundance than the other.  Typically White Crappies tend to do better in turbid water systems compared to Black Crappie.  Barring any setbacks, White Crappie should provide a quality angling opportunity after another year of growth.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
WHITE BASS  <br> 
 <br> 
White Bass were first sampled in 2005 at rate of 0.5 per gill net and since have increased to 3.7, 4.0, and 5.0 per gill net in 2009, 2013, and 2015, respectively.  Gill net catch rates are within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.3 to 9.9 per gill net).  In trap nets, catch rates have increased from 0.9 per trap net in 2009 to 1.0 per trap net in 2013 to 6.6 per trap net in 2015, all of which are above the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.2 to 0.7 per trap net).  White Bass were 4.1 to 16.3 inches long and averaged 11.8 inches.  White Bass grow fast in Round Lake, attaining a length of 12 inches by age-3.  The presence of multiple year classes and small fish indicates that White Bass naturally reproduce in Round Lake.  White Bass are aggressive predators that could potentially compete with other predators if prey is limited, but may also provide an additional angling opportunity in Round Lake.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
OTHER SPECIES <br> 
 <br> 
Five Northern Pike were captured in the survey, and were 24.7 to 37.4 inches long and averaged 30.1 inches.  Catches of Northern Pike have always been low in Round Lake; however, if you hook into one it should be large.  <br> 
 <br> 
Three Black Bullhead were captured in the survey, ranging from 13.1 to 14.0 inches and averaging 13.5 inches.  The Channel Catfish and Walleye population are keeping the Black Bullhead population low.  <br> 
  <br> 
The Freshwater Drum catch rate has increased from 2.0 per gill net in 2009 to 4.7 per gill net in 2013 to 5.3 per gill net in 2015, but is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.8 to 6.9 per gill net).  Lengths of Freshwater Drum ranged from 4.4 to 22.5 inches and averaged 14.9 inches.   <br> 
 <br> 
Bigmouth Buffalo abundance increased to 3.7 per gill net, up from 1.3 per gill net in 2013. Lengths of Bigmouth Buffalo ranged from 11.8 to 22.5 inches and averaged 18.6 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
Common Carp were captured at a rate of 0.6 per trap net, which is the lowest observed trap net catch rate for Common Carp in Round Lake, and is below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.0 to 5.5 per trap net).  Lengths of Common Carp ranged from 5.2 to 34.8 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> 
 <br> 
Best management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality.  Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2015-06-22',  County Name = 'Kanabec', Lake Name = 'Ann' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/21/2010 Clarity: 3.9' 
 Narrative = '<p>Ann is a 653 acre lake in Kanabec County managed primarily for Walleye and Northern Pike.  The water level is maintained by a Division of Fish and Wildlife sheet piling dam on the north end of the lake.  Lakeshore development is relatively light due largely to the wildlife management area on the southeast and northeast shores.  Shallow water substrates are dominated by sand but water quality can be an issue.  Like most shallow fertile lakes, Ann is subject to fairly heavy algae blooms in summer which limit water clarity.  An additional concern is curly-leaf pondweed densities in late spring and early summer.  There is currently only one public boat access on the lake with limited parking.  Although natural Walleye reproduction likely occurs, 300 pounds of Walleye fingerlings are stocked every fall.   <br> 
 <br> 
Ann Lake receives high fishing pressure at times, especially when the panfish bite is hot.  Although the abundance of Black Crappie and Bluegill is normal compared to similar lakes, both have had higher catch rates in previous assessments.  Nonetheless, anglers can expect quality fishing for both species.  During the May netting crappies averaged 9.6 inches with fish over 12 inches present.  Bluegills ranged up to 10.6 inches with a third of the catch exceeding 8 inches.   <br> 
 <br> 
The Northern Pike catch rate increased compared to the 2010 assessment but remains below the normal range for the lake type.  Northerns ranged from 17.5 to 31.2 inches.  The bulk of the pike captured were young fish less than 23 inches in length.  Walleye abundance continues to trend downward despite the switch to annual fingerling stocking in 2010.  However, the catch rate is still typical for the lake class.  Lengths ranged from 9.3 to 23.3 inches with a 1.1 pound average.  Trends in both Walleye and Northern Pike abundance have closely followed that of the Yellow Perch population.  One fourth of the perch catch exceeded 8 inches in length, an acceptable size for some anglers.  </p>'

 Narrative = '<p>Lake Eleven is a 290-acre lake in northern Kanabec County.  Despite being shallow with a 13 foot maximum, the fertile lake maintains good oxygen levels throughout the winter.  Angling pressure can be high at times, especially in the winter and early summer seasons.  Anglers can expect quality-size Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass, which average nearly 23 and 15 inches respectively.  The Walleye abundance improved slightly since the previous assessment in 2008, but Yellow Perch numbers continue to slip.  The Black Crappie and Bluegill catch was again higher than normal for the lake type.  Spring and summer catch rates were very similar for both species.  In the spring netting effort, Black Crappie averaged over 9 inches and Bluegill over 7 inches.</p>'

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2011-06-15',  County Name = 'Kanabec', Lake Name = 'Five' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/15/2011 Clarity: 9.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Lake Five, also called Bland Lake, is a small lake low in fertility and alkalinity. Moderate fishing pressure is directed at largemouth bass and bluegill, although some harvestable sized northern pike are present. <br> 
   <br> 
Black crappie numbers appeared low in the sampling, but anglers do target them winter and summer.  Bluegill were abundant in trap nets, with quality sized bluegill up to 9 inches present. However, growth is slow; 7 year old bluegills averaged less than 7 inches at capture. Crappie and bluegill average sizes could be easily impacted by increases in angler harvest.  <br> 
 <br> 
Sampling by night electrofishing in late May revealed good numbers of largemouth bass for a lake this size. The mean length was over 12 inches; one 19 inch bass was sampled. <br> 
 <br> 
Only 3 walleye were sampled in this survey, all from the 2009 stocking.  Walleye fingerlings were stocked from 2004-2009, but stocking was discontinued due to the lake's marginal capacity to support walleye.  <br> 
   <br> 
The lake is bordered to the south and south west by a wildlife management area which includes an earthen public access with parking for five vehicles. The road leading to the access can be rough and is accessible only by snowmobile or ATV in winter. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2015-09-14',  County Name = 'Kanabec', Lake Name = 'Knife' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 09/14/2015 Clarity: 2.1' 
 Narrative = '<p>Knife Lake is a 1,266 acre impoundment on the Knife River with an average depth of 9.1 feet. Water clarity is generally low and the lake is susceptible to algae blooms in the summer. The lake is managed primarily for Walleye and Northern Pike, with Largemouth Bass and panfish as secondary species.  An 18 to 24 inch protected slot regulation is in effect for Walleye, as well as a 24 to 36 inch protected slot for Northern Pike.  <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye in Knife Lake were sustained by natural reproduction from 1995 to 2006. However, test netting in 2006 indicated that the Walleye population had fallen below target levels and fall electrofishing from 2007 to 2009 indicated poor or no natural reproduction. Stocking efforts began in 2008 and fingerlings and/or fry were stocked through 2012.  Fall electrofishing since 2013 has found enough naturally-produced Walleye to forego fingerling stocking.  Despite the contribution of natural reproduction, the Walleye net catch, which remains below both the normal range for this lake class and the management goal for Knife Lake, has shown only a moderate increase since 2011.  However, it's worth noting that between spring trap netting and electrofishing efforts an additional 788 Walleyes were sampled. Measured Walleye ranged from 5.6 to 28.8 inches.  The catch was fairly evenly split between males, which averaged 14 inches, and females, which averaged 23 inches. Annual Walleye natural reproduction monitoring will dictate future fingerling stocking needs. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike have shown some increase in size structure since the 24 to 36 inch protected slot regulation began in 2003. Netted northerns ranged from 8 to 40 inches with a fairly even distribution among lengths.  The spring trap netting effort found both harvestable size fish below 24 inches and trophy sized fish greater than 36 inches available.  The Northern Pike fishery in Knife Lake appears to be sustaining its quality and maintaining adequate abundance. <br> 
  <br> 
Bluegill and Black Crappie are both present in normal abundance.  In the spring of 2015, 44% of the Bluegill catch exceeded 7 inches while 24% of the Black Crappie catch exceeded 8 inches.  By 2016 they should provide good angling opportunities for quality panfish.  <br> 
 <br> 
Spring electrofishing found a Largemouth Bass catch rate of 95 fish per hour, up from 73 per hour in 2011 and the second highest catch rate reported for the lake.  Bass averaged 14.1 inches and 1.6 pounds.  High numbers of adult Largemouth Bass, up to 19 inches, should provide good angling action.  Smallmouth Bass are also present in Knife Lake and the Knife River, but numbers in the lake are low. <br> 
 <br> 
Historically Knife Lake has supported high Yellow Perch populations. Recent catches have been lower than the levels present during the 1990's, but are at normal levels for the lake type.  Although perch serve primarily as a prey base for Walleye and Northern Pike, harvestable size fish are present.</p>'

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2010-07-06',  County Name = 'Kanabec', Lake Name = 'Quamba' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/06/2010 Clarity: 3.9' 
 Narrative = '<p>Quamba Lake is a shallow, fertile, turbid lake subject to irregular winterkills.  Winterkill of some severity has been recorded ten times since 1959.   The current management plan lists northern pike and walleye as primary species and largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie as secondary species.  <br> 
      <br> 
Biennial fry stocking combined with some natural reproduction has established a walleye fishery of normal numbers for the lake type.  Current stocking plans have switched the fry stocking to a yearly occurrence.  Quality sized walleye are present with fish averaging 21.8 inches and 3.8 pounds.   <br> 
      <br> 
Northern pike have been self sustaining since stocking ceased in 1995.  Pike numbers have shown a moderate increase since the 2005 information.  They are present in fishable numbers and, with fish over 30 inches available, their size should be acceptable to anglers.   <br> 
      <br> 
Likewise bluegill and black crappie provide quality angling at normal densities for the lake type.  Black crappie averaged 9 inches and half a pound in the trap nets while 21% of the bluegill exceeded 8 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Based on night electrofishing results, the largemouth bass abundance was lower than in previous assessments.  The population is still dominated by fish larger than 12 inches.  The lack of juvenile bass in consecutive electrofishing samples is puzzling.  Perhaps low winter oxygen levels are playing a role in bass recruitment. <br> 
      <br> 
Quamba Lake receives light to moderate fishing pressure.  During the 2010 assessment the majority of anglers were targeting panfish.  Walleye angling is popular earlier in the season.  Public access is available on the southwest shore with limited parking.</p>'

 Survey Date = '2013-07-01',  County Name = 'Kandiyohi', Lake Name = 'Bass' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/10/2013 Clarity: 17.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>A resurvey of Bass Lake was conducted in early July of 2013. Bass is a small (52 acres) and moderately productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. The maximum depth is 31 feet. A township public access with limited parking and turn around is located along the north shore. Residential development (11 homes) has occurred primarily along the north and west shoreline areas. Hardwoods dominate the east and south shorelines. Agricultural row crop drainage into the lake occurs via 3 inlets/tiles located along the west and north shores. Water clarity was excellent (secchi=17.5 feet) and the total phosphorus level relatively low (0.026 ppm) on June 10, 2013. Dissolved oxygen was low (< 1 ppm) in water depths greater than 18 feet during a 2013 mid-summer profile. Algae blooms often occur during the late summer months on Bass. A moderate algae bloom was present during the 2013 survey. Submergent vegetation densities (pondweed species) have been historically variable in the lake. The most frequently occurring submergent vegetation species during 2013 included water moss, filamentous algae, clasping-leaf pondweed and sago pondweed. Emergent vegetation consists of yellow waterlily (southwest corner), reed canary grass (scattered stands around the lake), cattails (north and east shoreline) and hardstem bulrush (east shoreline). Hardstem bulrush plants were transplanted into Bass Lake along the northeast and southwest corners of the lake in June of 1994. Shoalwater substrates consist mostly of sand, gravel and silt. A severe winterkill occurred during the 1996-97 winter due in part to heavy snow accumulations. Anglers target primarily northern pike, bluegill, black crappie and largemouth bass in Bass Lake. <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth bass numbers were abundant (74.77 fish/hour) in the 2013 spring electrofishing survey and above the Bass Lake historical average (53.33 fish/hour). The 2013 largemouth bass average size was moderate (0.99 pounds and 11.09 inches) from spring electrofishing. The Bass Lake historical average weight and length are 1.54 pounds and 12.68 inches. The 2013 catch rate of larger (>15 inches) largemouth bass was moderate (6.46 fish/hour). Largemouth bass growth rates were within the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2010 year class comprised 50% of the 2013 total largemouth bass spring electrofishing catch. Largemouth bass adults were stocked (22 fish) in Bass Lake during the spring of 1997 following the 1996-97 winterkill.  <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie numbers were moderately abundant in 2013 (13.67 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes and the Bass Lake historical average (8.35 fish/trapnet). The 2013 black crappie average size was moderate (0.36 pounds and 8.72 inches) from trapnets. The black crappie historical average weight and length are 0.24 pounds 7.29 inches respectively from trapnets. The 2013 catch rate of moderate sized (>8 inches) black crappie was excellent (13.33 fish/trapnet).  Black crappie growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 2-5. The 2010 black crappie year class comprised 96% of the 2013 black crappie catch. Black crappie adults were stocked into Bass during the spring of 1997 (121 fish) and 2000 (532 fish) following the 1996-97 winterkill. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike numbers were moderate in 2013 (4.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes and the Bass Lake historical average (5.76 fish/gillnet). The 2013 northern pike average size was moderately large (4.60 pounds and 27.03 inches) from the gillnet. The northern pike historical average weight is 3.25 pounds from gillnets. The 2013 catch rate of larger (>28 inches) northern pike was high (2.00 fish/gillnet). Northern pike growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 2-5. Approximately 40% of the northern pike captured in the 2013 gillnet were from the 2008 year class. Northern pike adults (48 fish) were stocked into Bass Lake during 1998. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch were absent in 2013 gillnet and trapnets. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 23.17 fish/gillnet. Walleye were also absent in 2013 gillnet and trapnets. The walleye historical catch rate is 1.56 fish/gillnet. The walleye historical average weight is 2.35 pounds from gillnets.  <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill numbers were abundant (70.00 fish/trapnet) and the average size was large (0.31 pounds and 7.28 inches) in 2013.  The bluegill historical average catch rate is 38.66 fish/trapnet. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.17 pounds from trapnets. The 2013 catch rate of moderate sized (>6 inches) bluegill was high (68.50 fish/trapnet). The 2013 catch rate of larger (> 8 inches) bluegill was also high (9.83 fish/trapnet). Bluegill growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2010 year class comprised 86% of the 2013 total bluegill catch. Bluegill adults (2,415 fish) were stocked into Bass Lake during the spring of 1997 following the 1996-97 winterkill. <br> 
 <br> 
Black bullhead numbers were low in 2013 (0.17 fish/trapnet). Black bullhead were absent from the 2013 gillnet. Yellow bullhead numbers were also low in the 2013 trapnets (0.50 fish/trapnet). There were no carp captured in the 2013 survey nets. The historical average catch rates are 15.65 black bullhead/trapnet, 1.44 yellow bullhead/trapnet and 0.63 carp/gillnet.  <br> 
 <br> 
Current fish management activities on Bass Lake include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, periodic winter oxygen testing, participating in local watershed initiatives, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Bass Lake fishery will be resurveyed in the 2018 for all fish species. <br>

 Narrative = '<p>A standard survey of Big Kandiyohi Lake was conducted during mid July of 2016. Big Kandiyohi is a large (2,683 acres), shallow (18 feet maximum depth), and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. High nutrient runoff flows into Big Kandiyohi during rain events via the shoreline areas, tiles, and several large ditches. The nutrient runoff sources are primarily from agricultural and municipal storm sewer runoff (Willmar) via Lake Wakanda in addition to normal lake residential (i.e. lawn runoff) sources. The Grass Lake Watershed Project was envisioned during the 1990's, but only recently has been funded by state grants and embraced by local governments in 2016. The project goals are to filter and store storm sewer runoff from the city of Willmar into a large wetland complex to reduce nutrients entering downstream into Lake Wakanda and Big Kandiyohi. Fluctuating water levels often occur in Big Kandiyohi due to numerous ditch and tile connections. High water level conditions resulted in significant bank erosion around the lake during the 2011 spring. Water clarity varies seasonally with generally good clarity during mid-May through June (secchi=3-10 feet), poor by late July through mid-August (< 3 feet) and improved clarity in the fall (> 3 feet). Water clarity was fair (5.5 feet) during the 2016 survey, but calm conditions and an intense blue-green algae bloom was present on the water surface. Intense blue-green algae blooms are common occurrences in Big Kandiyohi. Submergent vegetation densities are relatively low consisting mostly of sago pondweed, curly-leaf pondweed and water moss. Shoalwater substrates are varied, but consist mostly of sand, silt, and rubble. There are two popular county parks located along the lake (northeast and southwest sides) with 175 available recreational vehicle campsites. There were approximately 259 homes/cabins and 15 recreational vehicles counted excluding the two parks in 2011.  <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch numbers were abundant in 2016 (21.25 fish/gillnet) compared to normal range and historical average (12.13 fish/gillnet). The Yellow Perch average size (0.50 pounds, 10.1 inches) was large from gillnets and these fish exhibited excellent growth rates. There were also abundant Yellow Perch numbers (14.00 fish/gillnet) greater than 10.0 inches in 2016. The 2013 yellow perch year class comprised 86% of the 2016 yellow perch survey catch. Yellow Perch adults were recently stocked in 2015 (1,048 fish, 262 pounds) and 2016 (9,840 fish, 820 pounds). There were excellent local reports of winter angling success for Yellow Perch during 2017. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike numbers were low in 2016 (1.25 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range and historical average (2.70 fish/gillnet). The Northern Pike average size (3.26 pounds and 24.1 inches) was above the historical gillnet average (2.34 pounds). Northern Pike fingerlings (300-3,000 fish/year) were stocked recently from 2012 thru 2016. Northern Pike adults were last stocked in 2014 (882 fish, 490 pounds). <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill numbers were low in 2016 (0.20 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range and historical average (1.02 fish/trapnet). The Bluegill average size was small (0.06 pounds and 4.5 inches) from the 2016 trapnets. Bluegill growth potential can be over 10.0 inches as documented in the 2011 survey for Big Kandiyohi. Pre-spawn Bluegill adults were stocked into Big Kandiyohi from 1999-2001, 2003-2004 and 2007 to boost brood stock numbers. <br> 
 <br> 
Black Crappie numbers were moderately abundant in 2016 (5.33 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range. The 2016 Black Crappie average size (0.44 pounds and 9.2 inches) was moderate and similar to the historical average (0.51 pounds) from trapnets. The 2014 and 2013 year classes comprised 71% and 26% respectively of the 2016 Black Crappie survey catch. Black Crappie pre-spawn adults were stocked into Big Kandiyohi during 2011, 2010, 2002, 2001 and 1999. Local anglers recently reported good winter angling success for Black Crappie. <br> 
 <br> 
Channel Catfish numbers were abundant in the 2016 gillnets (7.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the historical average (3.38 fish/gillnet). The 2016 Channel Catfish average size (5.05 pounds and 22.3 inches) was large from gillnets. Channel Catfish were stocked into Big Kandiyohi during 1987 (21,417 yearlings, 1,521 pounds), 2005 (13,523 fingerlings, 165 pounds) and 2008 (13,541 fingerlings, 113 pounds). <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye numbers were moderately abundant in 2016 (11.25 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range and similar to the historical average (12.12 fish/gillnet). The 2016 Walleye average size (0.89 pounds and 13.5 inches) was small from gillnets. Walleye growth rates are within the Spicer Area normal range for Big Kandiyohi. The Walleye catch rate of fish 15.0 inches and larger was low (2.09 fish/gillnet) in 2016. The 2013 (fry stocked year) and 2014 (natural) Walleye year classes comprised 53% and 24% respectively of the 2016 gillnet and trapnet catch in Big Kandiyohi.  <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye natural reproduction in Big Kandiyohi is frequent, but generally insignificant based on previous fall and summer surveys. Big Kandiyohi was stocked recently with 2-3 million Walleye fry per year in the springs of 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2015. A fall night electrofishing survey for young of year "YOY" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Big Kandiyohi was last conducted during 2015. Moderate YOY Walleye numbers were captured in 2015 (46.0 YOY/hour, 4.8 inches). Yearling walleye numbers were also moderately abundant (16.0 fish/hour, 9.4 inches) in 2015. Fall electrofishing surveys indicated abundant YOY Walleye numbers in 2006 (177.0 YOY/hour, 5.5 inches), 2008 (135.6 YOY/hour, 4.8 inches), 2009 (60.0 YOY/hour, 5.1 inches), 2011 (272.0 YOY/hour, 5.8 inches) and 2013 (134.0 YOY/hour, 5.8 inches).  <br> 
 <br> 
Smallmouth Bass numbers were abundant in 2016 (3.25 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range and historical average (0.26 fish/gillnet) for Big Kandiyohi. The Smallmouth Bass average weight was large (1.94 pounds) from gillnets. The largest Smallmouth Bass captured was 17.1 inches. Smallmouth Bass growth rates were excellent. The 2012 and 2014 year classes comprised 41% and 35% of the 2016 Smallmouth Bass survey catch. Smallmouth Bass were first captured in a Big Kandiyohi survey during 1996.  <br> 
 <br> 
Common Carp numbers were abundant in 2016 (7.60 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range and historical average (5.96 fish/trapnet) and normal range of similar lakes. The 2016 Common Carp average size (7.36 pounds and 24.5 inches) was large from trapnets. Commercial netters harvested Common Carp (147,500 pounds) and Bigmouth Buffalo (49,400 pounds) from Big Kandiyohi in 2016. In the past, commercial Common Carp removal has been unsuccessful at significantly reducing abundance over time on large bodies of water. Presently, the cumulative removal effect on Big Kandiyohi Common Carp long term population numbers is unknown but likely negligible due to Common Carp's amazing ability (1.0 million eggs per 10-15 lb. female) to produce large year classes by relatively few numbers of adults in connected wetland and shallow lake areas. <br> 
 <br> 
Other fish species captured included moderate numbers of White Sucker (2.75 fish/gillnet), Bigmouth Buffalo (2.47 fish/trapnet) and Black Bullhead (23.52 fish/gillnet, 0.68 pounds average weight). The White Sucker and Bigmouth Buffalo average weights were 2.11 pounds and 2.84 pounds respectively. <br> 
 <br> 
Current fish management activities on Big Kandiyohi include protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, allowing commercial harvest of Common Carp, improving yellow perch spawning habitat, stocking various species as needed, and stocking Walleye fry every other year. The Big Kandiyohi Lake fishery will be surveyed in the 2021 summer for all fish species. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br>

 Survey Date = '2014-07-07',  County Name = 'Kandiyohi', Lake Name = 'Henderson' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/07/2014 Clarity: 9' 
 Narrative = '<p>A re-survey was conducted on Henderson Lake in early July of 2014. Henderson is a small (75 acres), deep (57 feet maximum), and lowly productive lake (2014 total phosphorus=0.015 ppm) located in Kandiyohi County. Henderson is part of the Hawk Creek Watershed. The water clarity was excellent on July 7, 2014 (secchi=9.0 feet). Dissolved oxygen was less than 1.0 ppm below 24 feet deep on July 7, 2014. Submergent vegetation (various pondweeds, water moss, coontail, and northern milfoil) was moderate to abundant within the littoral area of the lake. Filamentous algae was notable along the northeast corner of the lake in 2014. Algae blooms with a brown/red color have occasionally occurred in past years during the fall or spring turnover periods. Emergent vegetation is limited to a few small stands of hardstem bulrush along the west shore and common cattail along the west bay area. Shoalwater substrates consist mostly of sand, gravel, and rubble. The immediate watershed is small with hardwoods, wetlands, residential housing, pastures, agricultural row crops, and grasslands. There are no discernable inlets that flow into the lake. The outlet is connected to a marsh area west of the lake. The marsh area can connect to Ringo Lake during high water via a 30 inch steel culvert under U.S. Highway 71. Less desirable species such as black bullhead and carp have moved into Henderson from Ringo during high water events. Water levels were high during June and July of 2014. A slow no-wake zone was put in place for lakes in Kandiyohi and Stearns Counties during June thru early July of 2014. The DNR Spicer Fisheries Office manages Henderson Lake for largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, northern pike, yellow perch, and walleye. <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth bass were moderately abundant (54.71 fish/hour) in a 2014 spring electrofishing survey. The largemouth bass historical average catch rate is 57.27 fish/hour for Henderson Lake. The 2014 largemouth bass average size was small (0.78 pounds and 11.33 inches) from spring electrofishing. The historical average weight and length were 1.17 pounds and 12.42 inches. Low numbers of larger (15.00 plus inches) largemouth bass (3.53 fish/hour) were captured in 2014. Largemouth bass growth rates were poor. The 2010 year class comprised 43% of the 2014 total largemouth bass spring electrofishing catch.  <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie numbers were low (2.00 fish/trapnet) compared to the historical average (16.99 fish/trapnet). The 2014 black crappie average size was moderate (0.45 pounds and 9.27 inches) from trapnets. The black crappie historical average weight is 0.33 pounds from trapnets. Black crappie growth rates were poor. All of the black crappie captured were from either the 2009 or 2008 year classes. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike numbers of small fish (2.09 pounds and 20.43 inches average size) were abundant in 2014 (10.50 fish/gillnet) especially compared to the historical average of 5.43 fish/gillnet. The northern pike historical average weight is 3.18 pounds from gillnets. Northern pike growth rates were poor for ages 1-3, but excellent for ages 4-5. The majority of northern pike were from the 2012 and 2011 year classes. The largest northern pike captured was 32.7 inches from a gillnet in 2014. There have been occasional reports of large northern pike (10 pound plus) harvested in recent years from Henderson. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch were absent in both 2014 gillnets and trapnets. There were 4.67 yellow perch/gillnet in the previous 2009 assessment. The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 15.63 fish/gillnet. Adult perch were last stocked into Henderson during 2002 (556 fish, 270 pounds). <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye numbers were low in 2014 (1.50 fish/gillnet) but similar to the historical average of 1.61 fish/gillnet. The walleye average size was moderate (1.02 pounds and 14.32 inches) from 2014 gillnets. The walleye historical average weight was 2.46 pounds from gillnets. Walleye growth rates were poor. The majority of walleye captured were from 2010 and 2011 year classes. Walleye yearlings or adults have been stocked in recent years instead of fingerlings due to better potential survival in lakes with abundant bass and northern pike populations. Walleye natural reproduction has generally been infrequent and insignificant in Henderson Lake based on previous surveys.  <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill numbers were low in 2014 (12.17 fish/trapnet) compared to the historical average of 115.72 fish/trapnet. The bluegill average size was moderate (0.19 pounds and 5.85 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.13 pounds from trapnets. The largest bluegill captured was 8.0 inches from a trapnet in 2014. There were moderate numbers of bluegill 6.0 plus inches (7.33 fish/trapnet), but low numbers of bluegill 8 plus inches (0.17 fish/trapnet). Bluegill growth rates were generally poor to fair for ages 1-6. A variety of bluegill year classes were captured in 2014. <br> 
 <br> 
Black bullhead numbers were low in 2014 (0.17 fish/trapnet) compared to the historical average (1.24 fish/trapnet). The 2014 black bullhead average size was large (1.34 pounds and 13.27 inches) from trapnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.90 pounds from trapnets. <br> 
 <br> 
Common carp were not captured in 2014 (0.00 fish/gillnet). The carp historical average catch rate is 0.52 fish/gillnet.  <br> 
 <br> 
Current fish management activities on Henderson include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Henderson Lake fishery will be sampled in the 2019 spring for largemouth bass and summer for all fish species. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2013-06-10',  County Name = 'Kandiyohi', Lake Name = 'Lake Monongalia' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/10/2013 Clarity: 7.6' 
 Narrative = '<p>A resurvey of Middle Fork Crow Reservoir "MFCR", also known as Monongalia or Mud Lake, was conducted in June of 2013. MFCR is a large (1,565 acres) and productive reservoir located in Kandiyohi County with three distinct basins starting upstream to downstream include: Mud Lake also known as Monongalia, the reservoir, and the Mill Pond located within the city limits of New London. Residential development (176 homes/cabins) has occurred primarily along the west shoreline and bay areas of the reservoir portion adjacent to the city of New London. There are four public access sites located adjacent to the MFCR basins, which include one on the north shore of Mud Lake basin, two adjacent to the reservoir basin and one on the Mill Pond basin. The MFCR maximum depth is 14 feet, which occurs in the Mill Pond basin near the New London Dam. The depth in Mud Lake basin is usually less than 4 feet with abundant aquatic vegetation and limited development. The reservoir basin maximum depth is about 6 feet deep with development primarily along the west shores with relatively undeveloped hardwoods and wetlands along the east shore. Water quality (total phosphorus=0.036 mg/l) was moderate during June of 2013 for MFCR. Water clarity was moderate (7.6 feet) during June of 2013. A helixor aeration system operates in the mid-portion of the reservoir basin during the winter months. Partial winterkills are frequent occurrences during winters with abundant snowfall accumulations. Low dissolved oxygen and the release of high levels of hydrogen sulfide can also be persistent problems during the late winter/early spring months for MFCR basins. Storm water and residential lawn runoff from the city of New London and residential homes enters the reservoir portion. Agricultural row crop drainage into the MFCR occurs via several inlets/tiles, but mostly into the Mud Lake basin. The Middle Fork Crow River enters Mud Lake basin near the north shore, flows through Mud and into the reservoir basin, then Mill Pond, and eventually outlets at the New London Dam (southwest portion of Mill Pond). The New London Dam was replaced in 2010. It is a formidable fish barrier and is classified as a high hazard dam. The Middle Fork Crow River eventually flows into Nest Lake, Green Lake and Calhoun. <br> 
 <br> 
Emergent vegetation (cattail species, wild rice, waterlily species, etc.) densities were prevalent within the MFCR, especially in the Mud Lake basin. Submergent vegetation species are varied and often dense within the basins. Submergent vegetation densities were lower in 2013 and 2008 compared to 2003, especially within the Mud Lake basin. Boat travel was almost impossible during 2003 due to abundant vegetation, unlike 2013. Approximately 40 species/groups of aquatic vegetation were observed during the 2013 vegetation transect survey. The most commonly occurring submergent species present within the MFCR basins were water celery, sago pondweed, coontail, clasping-leaf pondweed and northern milfoil. Other abundant algal/floating/submergent species observed included muskgrass, lesser duckweed and various pondweed species. Intense filamentous algae blooms are common by early July. The most commonly occurring substrates included sand, detritus, muck, and silt. MFCR is also a popular fishery for northern pike, sunfish and largemouth bass.  <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth bass were not captured in either gillnets or trapnets during the 2013 or 2008 MFCR resurveys. Largemouth bass were captured in low numbers during other previous surveys and assessments.  <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie numbers were low in 2013 (0.93 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black crappie gillnet historical average catch rate was 0.78 fish/trapnet. The 2013 black crappie average size was moderate (0.44 pounds and 8.64 inches) from trapnets. Black crappie growth rates in MFCR were below the Spicer Area normal range for age 1 and near upper ends of the normal ranges for ages 2-6. The 2011 black crappie year class comprised 50% of the 2013 total black crappie catch. Black crappie adults were recently stocked in 2008 (468 fish, 117 pounds), 2010 (1,056 fish, 264 pounds) and 2011 (944 fish, 236 pounds). <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike numbers were high in 2013 (11.23 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes and the MFCR historical average (9.68 fish/gillnet). The 2013 northern pike average size was small (1.68 pounds and 19.10 inches) from gillnets. Abundant stunted northern pike numbers have been the norm due to abundant spawning habitat and limited preferred prey species (yellow perch). The northern pike historical average weight is 1.46 pounds from gillnets. The 2013 catch rate of northern pike >21 inches was fair (2.67 fish/gillnet). However, the 2013 catch rate of larger (>28 inches) northern pike was low (0.20 fish/gillnet). Northern pike growth rates in MFCR were below the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-8. The 2011 and 2010 year classes comprised 54% and 20% of the 2013 northern pike catch. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch numbers were low in 2013 (0.67 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes and the historical average (3.29 fish/gillnet). The 2013 yellow perch average weight (0.17 pounds) was moderate from gillnets. Yellow perch growth rates in MFCR were below the Spicer Area normal range for age 1, but within the normal ranges for ages 2-5. The 2007-10 year classes each comprised 33% of the 2013 yellow perch catch. Yellow perch were recently stocked in the 2013 fall (13,494 fish, 519 pounds). <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye numbers were low in 2013 (2.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The walleye historical catch rate is 1.83 fish/gillnet. The walleye average size was moderately large (2.00 pounds and 17.59 inches) in 2013. The walleye historical average weight is 2.10 pounds from gillnets. Walleye growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. The 2010 year class comprised 43% of the 2013 walleye catch. MFCR was stocked recently with 0.5 million walleye fry per year during 2009-2011 and 0.1 million fry during 2012. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill numbers were low in 2013 (0.40 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes and the MFCR historical average (6.70 fish/trapnet). The 2013 bluegill average size was large (0.35 pounds and 6.76 inches) from trapnets. The bluegill historical average weight is 0.24 pounds from trapnets. Bluegill growth rates in MFCR were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-7. The 2011 and 2010 year classes comprised 50% and 33% respectively of the 2013 bluegill catch. Bluegill adults were last stocked in 2004 (1,365 fish, 195 pounds). <br> 
 <br> 
Pumpkinseed sunfish numbers were abundant in 2013 (9.20 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes. The pumpkinseed sunfish historical average catch rate is 6.56 fish/trapnet for MFCR. The 2013 MFCR pumpkinseed sunfish average size was moderate (6.39 inches and 0.24 pounds) from trapnets.  <br> 
 <br> 
Hybrid sunfish abundance in 2013 (1.07 fish/trapnet) was below the historical average (1.97 fish/trapnet) in MFCR. The hybrid sunfish average size was large (7.16 inches and 0.39 pounds) in 2013.  <br> 
 <br> 
Black bullhead numbers were abundant in 2013 (64.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes. The black bullhead historical average catch rate is 37.74 fish/gillnet for MFCR. The 2013 black bullhead average size was small (0.21 pounds) from gillnets.  <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow bullhead numbers were also abundant in 2013 (13.67 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range of similar lakes. The 2013 yellow bullhead average weight was moderate (0.37 pounds).  <br> 
 <br> 
Other fish species of interest captured in the 2013 included abundant numbers of carp (5.07 fish/trapnet) and moderate numbers of white sucker (2.33 fish/gillnet). The carp and white sucker historical average catch rates were 3.08 carp/trapnet and 2.74 white sucker/gillnet for MFCR. The 2013 carp and white sucker average weights were 5.91 pounds and 2.14 pounds respectively.  <br> 
 <br> 
Current fish management activities on MFCR include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting local residents and Kandiyohi County in the operation of the aeration system, protecting native aquatic vegetation through the permit process, preventing and educating about the spread of invasive species, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The MFCR fishery will be assessed in the 2018 summer for all fish species. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2016-07-11',  County Name = 'Kandiyohi', Lake Name = 'Lake Wakanda' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/13/2016 Clarity: 5.66' 
 Narrative = '<p>A standard survey of Lake Wakanda was conducted during early July of 2016. A fall night electrofishing survey was conducted on September 12, 2016 to assess young of year "YOY" (fingerling sized) Walleye abundance. Wakanda is a large (1,754 acres), shallow (15 feet maximum depth), turbid, aerated and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Residential development is limited to the south shore. Wakanda connects to several shallow winterkill prone lakes (Little Kandiyohi, Kasota and Minnetaga) and eventually outlets into several large ditch systems eventually flowing into Big Kandiyohi and Lake Lillian. Partial winterkills of fish occurred during the mid to late 1990's due to high snowfall events or operational problems with the aeration system. A significant winterkill of gamefish and Common Carp occurred during January/February of 2013. The helixor aeration system was unable to provide adequate oxygen levels due in part to high snowfall accumulations. The helixor aeration system was not operated during the 2013-14 winter in part to facilitate a winterkill of undesirable fish (Common Carp) in Wakanda and also because the 2013 Walleye fry stocking was a failure. Dissolved oxygen levels were measured from 1 to 1.9 ppm during early February of 2014. Common Carp and Black Bullhead were present in 2014 ice out nets in Wakanda. It appears that even with a severe and prolonged winter with low oxygen conditions that a complete winterkill of undesirable fish species (Common Carp, Black Bullhead) did not occur in 2014. The helixor aeration was moved into shallower water with more rock substrates and away from silt and muck substrates in the fall of 2014. The 2014-15 winter had mild temperatures and little snow accumulation resulting in good oxygen levels in many susceptible winterkill lakes. The Wakanda helixor aeration system appeared to maintain dissolved oxygen levels at 5.0 ppm throughout the 2014-15 and 2015-16 winters, however nearby shallow lakes without aeration had higher oxygen levels (>7 ppm). <br> 
 <br> 
Submergent vegetation densities are variable in Wakanda. Sago pondweed is usually the most frequently occurring submergent species. Blue-green algae blooms are often intense and common during mid to late summer months. Wakanda receives high flows of agricultural and storm sewer runoff via tiles and ditches. Water clarity is often good from ice out to mid-June, but poor during the remainder of the summer. The secchi disc reading was 2.0 feet on July 15, 2016. Intense blue-green algae blooms were notably absent in Wakanda during July of 2016 unlike previous years and other nearby lakes (Big Kandiyohi). Water levels were above normal during the summer and fall of 2016. Dissolved oxygen levels were moderate (6.4-9.1 ppm) throughout the water column during the July 2016 survey. Total phosphorus levels (0.177 ppm) were high on June 13, 2016. Local residents and various government officials are developing a new comprehensive management plan for Wakanda. A large upstream wetland restoration (Grass Lake Project) is currently underway to potentially reduce or buffer storm water runoff from the city of Willmar and improve incoming water quality flowing into Wakanda and Big Kandiyohi. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch numbers were moderate in 2016 (15.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and the historical average 17.99 fish/gillnet. The Yellow Perch average size was large (0.38 pounds and 9.2 inches from gillnets. The Yellow Perch historical average weight is 0.29 pounds from gillnets. There were moderate numbers of Yellow Perch 8.0 inches and larger in the 2016 survey catch. Yellow Perch growth rates were excellent. The 2014 year class comprised 76% of the 2016 Yellow Perch survey catch. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike numbers were moderate in 2016 (4.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes, but below the historical average (7.68 fish/gillnet). The Northern Pike average size was large (6.77 pounds and 31.5 inches) from gillnets. The Northern Pike historical average weight is 2.91 pounds from gillnets. The Northern Pike catch rate of 28.00 inches and larger was high (4.00 fish/gillnet) in 2016. Northern Pike growth rates were excellent. The 2013 and 2012 year classes each comprised 36% of the 2016 Northern Pike survey catch. Local anglers reported good success catching large northern pike during the 2016 summer. <br>

Bluegill numbers were low in 2016 (0.53 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The Bluegill historical average catch rate is 1.26 fish/trapnet. The 2016 Bluegill average size was small (0.11 pounds and 4.6 inches) from trapnets. The Bluegill historical average weight is 0.10 pounds from trapnets. Bluegill growth rates were above the Spicer Area 75th quartiles for ages 1-5. The 2015 year class comprised 88% of the 2016 Bluegill survey catch. <br> 
  <br> 
Black Crappie numbers were low in 2016 (0.33 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The Black Crappie historical average catch rate is 0.61 fish/trapnet. Low numbers of small sized Black Crappie (1.50 fish/gillnet, 0.18 pounds average weight) were captured in the 2016 gillnets. The 2016 Black Crappie average size was small (0.25 pounds and 7.52 inches) from trapnets. The Black Crappie historical average weight is 0.41 pounds and 0.12 pounds from trapnets and gillnets respectively. Black Crappie growth rates were excellent. The 2015 year class comprised 75% of the Black Crappie survey catch. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye numbers were abundant in 2016 (39.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and the historical average (20.71 fish/gillnet). The 2016 Walleye average size was moderate (1.05 pounds and 14.7 inches) from gillnets. The Walleye historical average weight is 1.28 pounds from gillnets. There were abundant Walleye 15.0 inches and larger (16.50 fish/gillnet) in the 2016 survey catch. Walleye growth rates were good. The 2014 year class comprised 96% of the 2016 Walleye survey catch. Local anglers reported good angling success for Walleye during the 2016 summer. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye natural reproduction is probably insignificant during most years, although adequate windswept shoal water substrates for good spawning habitat are present in Wakanda. Approximately 1.6 million walleye fry were stocked each year during the 2016, 2014 (Spicer strain) and 2013 springs. YOY Walleye numbers were abundant (90.0 YOY/hour, 6.8 inches) in 2016. Abundant YOY walleye numbers were captured (464.0 YOY/hour, 7.9 inches) in the 2014 fall electrofishing survey. No YOY walleye were captured in the 2013 fall electrofishing survey.  <br> 
 <br> 
Channel Catfish abundance was moderate (1.50 fish/gillnet) in 2016. The 2016 Channel Catfish average size was large from gillnets (8.22 pounds, 27.7 inches). Channel Catfish were first documented in Wakanda during a 2006 survey. Channel Catfish have been stocked (Big Kandiyohi) or moved (Lillian) into other lakes within the South Fork of Crow River Watershed. The Channel Catfish may have moved into the Wakanda from the outlet via the connected tiles and ditches or were illegally stocked. <br> 
 <br> 
Bigmouth Buffalo numbers were low in 2016 (0.40 fish/trapnet). The 2016 Bigmouth Buffalo average size was 3.48 pounds from trapnets. The historical average weight is 7.54 pounds. <br> 
 <br> 
Black Bullhead numbers were low in 2016 (14.33 fish/trapnet) compared to the historical average (215.35 fish/trapnet). Black Bullhead abundance in 2016 gillnets (42.50 fish/gillnet) was also below the historical average catch rate (82.07 fish/gillnet). The 2016 Black Bullhead average size was moderate (0.34 pounds and 8.4 inches) from trapnets. The Black Bullhead historical average weight is 0.19 pounds and 0.26 pounds from trapnets and gillnets respectively.  <br> 
 <br> 
Common Carp numbers were abundant in 2016 (12.27 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The Common Carp historical average catch rate is 19.90 fish/trapnet. The 2016 Common Carp average size was large (8.40 pounds and 25.1 inches) from trapnets. The Common Carp historical average weight is 3.61 pounds from trapnets. <br> 
 <br> 
Current fish management activities on Wakanda include monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting Kandiyohi County in operating the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, and stocking various fish species as warranted. All fish species will be sampled in 2021. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br>

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/22/2016 Clarity: 7.4' 
 Narrative = '<p>A standard survey was conducted on Lake Lillian during late June of 2016. Lake Lillian is a large (1,151 acres), shallow (8 feet), turbid and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. Lillian is a designated waterfowl feeding and resting area during the open waterfowl season. Motor propelled watercraft are prohibited except for trolling motors with battery power of 12 volts or less during the open waterfowl season. High nutrient runoff inflows are common into Lillian during rain events from agricultural sources via the shoreline areas, tiles, and ditches. The outlet of Big Kandiyohi flows via a large ditch into the west side of Lake Lillian. The Lake Lillian outlet flows into the South Fork of Crow River. Intense blue-green algae blooms are common in Lake Lillian during the summer months. Hardstem bulrush and cattails are abundant in Lillian. Other aquatic vegetation species present are limited mostly to sago pondweed, filamentous algae and water moss. The water clarity was excellent (secchi disc=7.4 feet) for Lillian on June 22, 2016. Partial winterkills have rarely occurred in Lillian (1996-97 winter) and resulted in only minor losses of gamefish numbers. However, a significant winterkill (primarily Common Carp and Walleye) occurred during January/February of 2014. We did catch low numbers of Common Carp, Walleye, White Sucker and Yellow Perch in ice out nets during the spring of 2014. Local anglers reported good success catching large Yellow Perch and small Walleye (12-14 inches) during January of 2017. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike numbers were moderate in 2016 (2.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes and the same as the historical average. The 2016 Northern Pike average size was small (2.36 pounds and 22.2 inches) from gillnets. The historical average weight is 2.95 pounds. Growth rates were excellent. The 2014 year class comprised 100% of the 2016 Northern Pike survey catch. Northern pike fingerlings (5,391 fish) were stocked into Lillian during early June of 2014. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch numbers were moderate in 2016 (16.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 26.93 fish/gillnet. The 2016 Yellow Perch average size was large (0.50 pounds and 10.1 inches) from gillnets and growth rates were excellent. There were abundant numbers of Yellow Perch 10.0 inches and greater (10.50 fish/gillnet) in the 2016 survey catch. Yellow Perch were fast growing following the 2014 winterkill. The 2013 and 2014 year classes comprised 67% and 30% respectively of the 2016 Yellow Perch survey catch. Yellow Perch exhibited greater low winter oxygen survival in Lillian during 2014 than other gamefish species. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye numbers were moderately abundant in 2016 (9.00 fish/gillnet) compared the normal range for similar lakes and the historical average (6.50 fish/gillnet). The 2016 Walleye average size was small (0.43 pounds and 10.7 inches) from June gillnets. The 2014 year class comprised 93% of the 2016 Walleye survey catch. Walleye growth rates appeared good during the 2016 summer and fall based on the average size (12-14 inches) anglers were catching in 2017. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye natural reproduction is generally insignificant in Lake Lillian. Fish movement can occur into Lake Lillian from Big Kandiyohi or the South Fork of Crow River. The Walleye population is maintained by fry stockings (0.8-1.6 million) with the most recent stockings occurring during 2008-2009, 2011, 2014 and 2015. Approximately 1 million Walleye fry were stocked in 2015. A fall night electrofishing survey was conducted for young of year "YOY" (fingerling sized) Walleye on Lake Lillian during September 8, 2015. Abundant numbers of YOY Walleye (72.0 YOY/hour, 5.3 inches) were observed in the 2015 fall electrofishing survey. Abundant numbers of YOY Walleye (174.0 YOY/hour, 6.2 inches average) were also observed in the 2014 fall electrofishing survey. Yearling Walleye (2014 year class) were also abundant (28.0 fish/hour, 10.1 inches) in 2015. There were abundant YOY Walleye numbers documented in fall electrofishing surveys prior to 2014; however the majority of these year classes probably did not survive the January/February 2014 winterkill event. <br> 
 <br> 
Black Crappie and Bluegill numbers were low (<1.0 fish/trapnet) in 2016 as expected following a winterkill. The Black Crappie sampled was from the 2014 year class. All Bluegill sampled were from the 2015 year class. <br> 
 <br> 
Other fish species captured during 2016 included low numbers of Common Carp (1.00 fish/trapnet), Black Bullhead (2.42 fish/trapnet), Bigmouth Buffalo (0.17 fish/trapnet), Smallmouth Bass (1.00 fish/gillnet) and White Sucker (0.50 fish/gillnet). No Channel Catfish were captured in Lillian during 2016. <br> 
 <br> 
Current fish management activities on Lake Lillian include monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, and stocking various fish species as warranted. All fish species will be sampled in 2021. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2016-07-05',  County Name = 'Kandiyohi', Lake Name = 'Minnetaga' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/13/2016 Clarity: 1.42' 
 Narrative = '<p>A standard survey of Minnetaga was conducted during early July of 2016. A fall electrofishing survey was conducted on September 12, 2016 to assess young of year "YOY" (fingerling sized) Walleye abundance in Minnetaga. An initial fish survey was completed in 2007. Minnetaga is a moderate sized (791 acres), shallow (9 feet deep), turbid and productive lake located in Kandiyohi County. There are two public access sites along the east shore which include a newly completed state owned gravel boat ramp and a road right away access off the county gravel road. Low water levels can make large boat access difficult at the public sites. An Aquatic Management Area is located across the road along Lake Kasota. Moderate nutrient runoff inflows are common into Minnetaga during rain events from agricultural sources via the shoreline areas, tiles, and ditches. The outlet flows into Lake Kasota (6 feet deep) which connects to other shallow lakes (Little Kandiyohi and eventually Lake Wakanda). A swinging finger fish barrier is located on the downstream (Kasota side) culvert end of the outlet. Intense blue-green algae blooms can be common in Minnetaga during the summer months. Aquatic vegetation species present are limited mostly to sago pondweed, filamentous algae and water moss. The water clarity was poor (secchi disc=1.4 feet) for Minnetaga on June 13, 2016. The water is a brown stained color. Winterkills have been relatively uncommon in Minnetaga during recent years. A partial winterkill of gamefish may have occurred during the 2007 08 winter due to low oxygen conditions; however, there were no local reports of dead fish seen along the shore in the 2008 spring. Excellent Walleye fishing had occurred prior to January of 2013 on both Minnetaga and Kasota. Nearby, connected Lake Kasota and Lake Wakanda had significant winterkills of Common Carp and Walleye during late January or early February of 2013. No significant numbers of dead fish were noted on Minnetaga during the spring of 2014. Ice out trapnets captured Walleye that were 20+ inches in size from Minnetaga during the spring of 2013. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike numbers were low in 2016 (0.50 fish/gillnet) compared to then normal range of similar lakes. The 2007 Northern Pike catch rate was 6.00 fish/gillnet. The 2016 Northern Pike average size was large (7.91 pounds and 33.23 inches) from gillnets. Minnetaga has been a popular shore fishing area for catching large Northern Pike in the past. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch numbers were moderately abundant in 2016 (19.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The 2007 Yellow Perch catch rate was 28.50 fish/gillnet. The 2016 Yellow Perch average was moderate (0.32 pounds and 8.79 inches) from gillnets. There were abundant numbers of Yellow Perch 8.0 inches and larger in the 2016 survey catch. Yellow Perch growth rates were excellent. The 2013 year class comprised 69% of the 2016 Yellow Perch survey catch. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye numbers were abundant in 2016 (39.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The 2007 Walleye catch rate was 9.25 fish/gillnet. The 2016 Walleye average size was small (0.84 pounds and 12.24 inches) from gillnets. There were abundant numbers of Walleye 15.0 inches and larger in the 2016 survey catch. Walleye growth rates were average. The 2014 year class comprised 73% of the 2016 Walleye survey catch. Local anglers reported excellent success catching Walleye from shore during the 2016 fall. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye natural reproduction is generally insignificant in Minnetaga. Walleye movement in or out of Minnetaga is possible with connected Kasota and Wakanda Lakes. Walleye fry (about 770,000 fry per year) were recently stocked into Minnetaga from 2008 2012, 2014 and 2016. YOY Walleye abundance was low in 2016 (4.0 YOY/hour, 6.9 inches). YOY Walleye numbers were abundant (192.0 YOY/hour, 5.9 inches) in the 2014 fall electrofishing survey. No fall electrofishing surveys were conducted in 2011-2012 due to poor access and low water conditions. No yearling Walleye were captured in Minnetaga during 2014 or 2016. Walleye fry will be stocked in 2017 due to low YOY Walleye numbers in 2016.  <br> 
 <br> 
Black Bullhead numbers were low in 2016 (4.25 fish/trapnet, 21.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for similar lakes. The 2007 Black Bullhead catch rates were 3.67 fish/trapnet and 36.00 fish/gillnet. The 2016 Black Bullhead average size was moderate (0.42 pounds).  <br> 
 <br> 
Common Carp numbers were abundant in 2016 (15.17 fish/trapnet, 16.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for similar lakes. The 2007 Common Carp catch rates were 3.67 fish/trapnet and 7.25 fish/gillnet. The 2016 Common Carp average sizes were moderate from trapnets (4.20 pounds and 19.4 inches) and small from gillnets (1.96 pounds and 15.9 inches). <br> 
 <br> 
Other fish species captured during 2016 included high numbers of White Sucker (32.00 fish/gillnet). Low numbers of Bigmouth Buffalo (0.17 fish/trapnet), Black Crappie (0.25 fish/trapnet) and Channel Catfish (0.08 fish/trapnet) were also caught in 2016. <br> 
 <br> 
Current fish management activities on Minnetaga include monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, encouraging land owners to implement best management practices in the watershed, and stocking various fish species as warranted. All fish species will be sampled in 2021. Fall electrofishing surveys will be conducted during Walleye fry stocked years to assess the success or failure of the stockings. <br>

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/19/2013 Clarity: 4.9' 
 Narrative = '<p>August Lake is characterized as a lake class 12 lake and is located eight miles east and 10 miles south of Winton.  Public access is from USFS #377 (Tomahawk Rd.) take USFS #388 north to the August Lake Road, go west to the north end of August Lake.  USFS has removed a large boulder and small trailers can now be backed into the lake.  The lake is 228.7 acres, 96% littoral with a maximum depth of 19 feet and a Secchi disc reading of 4.9 feet in brown bog stained water. Like most lakes in the area it has very soft water with low fertility. Boulder is by far the most common shoreline substrate. Vegetation was found growing to a maximum depth of six feet, 45 species/groups of aquatic vegetation were identified, all rated "rare".  Five inlets enter the lake, one outlet exits along the southeast shore.  There are 2 USFS designated campsites on this lake. One campsite is accessible by foot and the other by water only.  There are two other old campsites are on the lake. One site near the outlet is overgrown and gets little use. The other is on a point along the northwest shore, is well groomed and gets regular use. <br> 
 <br> 
The 2013 Walleye gill net catch of 7.5/lift was slightly above average for lake class 12.  Average weight of 0.77 pounds was below average.  The largest fish sampled was 22.3 inches and weighed 3.9 pounds.  The lake is stocked with fingerlings in even numbered years. In 2013, 27% of the Walleyes were from non-stocked years. Reproduction has been documented, but similar to most past assessments, the majority of strong year classes correspond with stocked years. Growth of Walleye is faster than average in August Lake for the Finland Area. <br> 
  <br> 
Northern Pike catch of 3.67/lift is near the lake class average. The average weight of 1.98 pounds is above average. The largest fish sampled was 33.9 inches and weighed 8.7 pounds. Growth of Northern Pike is slightly faster than average for the Finland Area. <br> 
Yellow Perch catch of 3.67/lift and average weight of 0.11 pounds are both below average for the lake class. The largest fish was only 8.1 inches. Over 4,000 young-of-the-year Yellow Perch were sampled indicating that perch provide a valuable forage base in August Lake rather than a targeted species for anglers. Growth of Yellow Perch is average for the Finland Area. <br> 
 <br> 
White Sucker catch of 6/lift with an average weight of 1.78 pounds was below average. Other species sampled were Blacknose Shiner, Bluntnose Minnow, Golden Shiner, Johnny Darter, Pumpkinseed and Rock Bass. <br>

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/24/2013 Clarity: 15' 
 Narrative = '<p>Bean Lake is characterized as a lake class 8 lake and is located one mile northwest of Silver Bay in the Lake Superior Watershed.  The lake lies within a portion of Tettegouche State Park that allows hunting, ATVs, snowmobiles and outboard motors.  Public access is a carry-in on the south end of the lake from a snowmobile/ATV trail that originates in Silver Bay.  There is a small picnic area with a fire ring and cleared areas to pitch small tents at the access.  A second access on the north end of the lake is the portage trail to Bear Lake.  The lake is 32 acres, 50% littoral with a maximum depth of 26 feet and a Secchi disk reading of 15 feet in light green water.  A lake water sample was collected and analyzed, indicating moderately soft water of low fertility.  Boulder and rubble were rated "common" shoreline substrate, with gravel, sand, muck and detritus rated "rare". Vegetation was found growing to a maximum depth of nine feet, 15 species/groups of aquatic vegetation were identified, all rated "rare".  One inlet enters the lake on the north end originating in Bear Lake.  One outlet exits on the south end near the access.  <br> 
 <br> 
The catch of Rainbow Trout in 2013 was 5/lift in two gill net sets with a mean weight of 0.71 pounds.  Beginning in 2006, yearling Rainbow Trout have been stocked annually.  The largest fish sampled in 2013 was 17.5 inches and weighed 2.1 pounds.  Two age-2 fish were sampled, while the remainder of the catch was yearlings from this year stocking.  Since management changed to annual stocking the net catches have increased and local anglers have expressed satisfaction level has also increased. <br> 
 <br> 
The catch of Splake in 2013 was 8/lift with an average weight of 0.72 pounds.  Splake fingerlings are stocked in odd numbered years.  All fish sampled in 2013 were between 11.1 and 14.2 inches and were age-2.  Growth of Splake was slightly faster than average for the Finland Area. <br> 
 <br> 
The catch of White Sucker in 2013 was 99.5/lift, well above average for the lake class with an average weight of 0.8 pounds.  Past assessments revealed similar results of very high numbers with small average size.  The high numbers of White Suckers in Bean Lake likely compete with trout and affect the growth potential for trout in this lake. <br> 
 <br> 
Bean Lake gets a high amount of use due to its close proximity to Silver Bay, both summer and winter.  Because of a good ATV/snowmobile trail that leads to the lake, many locals ride out to the lake fishing, picnicking or just sightseeing.  It is highly regarded for its natural beauty and is a destination for people using the Superior Hiking Trail. <br>

The lake lies within a portion of Tettegouche State Park that allows hunting, ATVs, snowmobiles and outboard motors.  Public access is a 0.2 mile portage trail from Bean Lake on the southwest portion of the lake.  A second access is the Superior Hiking Trail which traverses city and state land on the ridge along the south side of the lake.  There is a small user developed trail to the northeast end of the lake where there is a campsite with two areas to set up tents.  The lake is 17 acres, with a maximum depth of 69 feet; the water is very clear with a light green tint.  A lake water sample was collected and analyzed, indicating very soft water of low fertility with a total alkalinity of 15 and total phosphorus of 0.010.  Boulder and rubble are very common shoreline substrate, while gravel, sand, muck and detritus rare in occurrence.  Vegetation is very rare, horsetail is the only emergent all others are terrestrial bog species.  No submersed vegetation was observed.  One outlet exits on the south end near the access, flowing into Bean Lake. <br> 
 <br> 
The 2013 Lake Trout catch of 0.67/lift was below average for this type of lake class.  The average weight of 7.11 pounds greatly exceeds average.  Two fish were sampled, one 7 pounds the other nearly 7.5 pounds.  Lake Trout appear to be naturally reproducing in low numbers as the last stocking occurred in 1970. <br> 
 <br> 
The 2013 Splake catch of 12.67/lift was above average compared to other Splake lakes in the Finland Area and was the highest catch on record.  Average weight of 0.60 pounds is average by Finland Area standards.  Splake fingerlings are stocked in odd numbered years.  <br> 
 <br> 
The 2013 White Sucker catch of 6/lift was about average for the lake class. Average weight of 0.14 pounds is much smaller than average. The historic catch has been similar with average numbers of small fish. Brook Stickleback, Fathead Minnow, Finescale Dace and Iowa Darter were also sampled in minnow traps. <br>

 Lake Clarity = '' 
 Narrative = '<p>Becoosin Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 14, which consists of 92 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are very small, shallow, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Becoosin Lake is typical of lakes in this lake class except that it is larger (52 acres) than the lake class average size of 23 acres.Becoosin Lake was thermally stratified on 08/17/98 and the oxygen level dropped very abruptly from good (5 ppm) at 9 ft to poor (0.4 ppm) at 10 ft, where the temperature was 66 F.  The bottom temperature was 52 F.  Inlet 1 appears to originate in a small lake 0.5 mi SW of Becoosin Lake; bogs and beaver dams likely limit fish movement through this inlet.  Inlet 2 drains a small bog area.  The outlet eventually flows to Parent Lake, but beaver dams, bogs, and steep gradients limit fish movement.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly boulder, with lower amounts of ledgerock and rubble.  Aquatic plants grew to a depth of 2 ft and were very sparse except for concentrations in small bays.Becoosin Lake ranks as mesotrophic-to-eutrophic.  The amount of phosphorus in the water is high for such a remote and infertile lake.Fish sampling in the 1998 survey consisted of three standard shallow gillnet sets.  Trapnets were not set due to the difficult portage access.  Collapsible minnow traps were set to sample small fish.The total catch of fish in the gillnets of 29 fish/net (23 lb/net) was normal for this lake class.  Fish populations were dominated by white sucker and yellow perch, although golden shiner, pearl dace, and finescale dace were also captured.Sucker numbers (13.3/gillnet) were normal for this lake class.  Sucker sizes averaged 1.1 lb, which is also normal for this lake class.  Yellow perch numbers (15.3/gillnet) were normal for this lake class.  Perch sizes averaged 0.6 lb, which is larger than normal for this lake class.  The largest perch was 13.6" (1.1 lb).  Perch growth was normal for the area.  A few of the perch were infected with yellow grub.  Yellow grub is a common parasite that is native to the area.  It is found in or under the skin and is often removed by filleting.  It cannot infect humans and is killed at cooking temperatures.Notable by their absence in this lake are northern pike, as they are present in 54 percent of the lakes in Lake Class 14.</p>'

The fish sample in 2010 consisted of northern pike, walleye, white sucker and yellow perch.  Walleye were sampled in above average numbers for northeastern Minnesota lakes with similar characteristics.  The average size of walleye was small at slightly less than 0.7 pound (11.75 inches); the largest walleye was 24.4 inches.  The walleye catch was similar to catches in previous population assessments, dating back to 1962, where high numbers of small walleye were also sampled.  Walleye growth was slow in Bog Lake compared to fish sampled in other Finland area assessments. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike were sampled in below average numbers for the lake class.  The northern pike average size was 3.5 pounds (24.5 inches); the largest northern pike was just over 32 inches.  Historically, the northern pike catch has been low numbers of small fish; the average size sampled in 2010 was the largest recorded in any assessment. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch were sampled in above average numbers of above average size in the 2010 lake survey.  The average weight was 0.33 pound (8.1 inches); 52% of the yellow perch sampled were greater than 8 inches, the largest 11.4 inches.  Previous investigations have also recorded high numbers of good size yellow perch. <br> 
 <br> 
Although Bog Lake is not on a major canoe route to other interior BWCAW lakes, the current fish community structure and abundance should attract anglers to this lake.  The lake's name is a misnomer as hard sand (not bog) is common along much of the shoreline.   <br>

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/07/2015 Clarity: 3.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Comfort Lake is located 11 miles north and five miles east of Isabella in the US Superior National Forest.  The lake is 42 acres with a maximum depth of seven feet.  The water has low clarity (3.5 feet) and is a brown bog stain color.  Comfort Lake is a very soft water lake of moderate fertility typical of northeast Minnesota.  Muck, decaying organic matter, and sand were the most common bottom substrates followed by boulder and gravel with a very limited amount of rubble and ledge rock present.  Aquatic vegetation grows to a depth of 5.5 feet with floating bur-reed, wild rice and white waterlily the most common species.  Comfort Creek exits the lake on the north end and enters the Island River a short distance away.  The lake is completely surrounded by US Forest Service land and nearly the entire shoreline and immediate area around the lake was burned in the Pagami Creek Fire of 2011. <br> 
 <br> 
Comfort Lake is less than a mile south of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and is used by fishermen, hunters, trappers, wild rice harvesters, and canoers.  Public access is an 80 yard trail with carry down steps from the parking area off of USFS Rd 913C to the southwest end of the lake.  It can also be accessed from the Island River by portaging or paddling up the outlet, (Comfort Creek).  While the public access is accessible by most highway legal vehicles it is best suited to higher clearance vehicles such as pickup truck or SUVs.  Comfort Creek crosses USFS Rd. 913C upstream of Comfort Lake and USFS Rd. 356 upstream of Section 29 Lake, both locations are locally known as good spots to harvest suckers in the spring when they are running.  The lake and surrounding area gets a fair amount of hunting pressure, mainly for ducks, geese, and grouse in the fall.  It is also a good place to potentially spot a moose.  The lake borders the Island River making canoe trips a possible option.  The dark water and abundance of boulders make outboard use a bit difficult.  Although the area was burned by the Pagami Creek fire in 2011, it is still very scenic and a popular place for recreationists interested in multiple outdoor experiences.  <br> 
 <br> 
The 2015 survey was performed to gather background biological information to develop a management strategy for Comfort Lake.  No stocking has been done on the lake and all populations are maintained through natural reproduction.   <br> 
 <br> 
The catch rates for Walleyes were slightly below average compared to similar lakes in the Finland Area with an average weight of 1.3 pounds.  The largest fish sampled was 25.4 inches long and weighed 5.7 pounds.  Walleye growth is faster than average by Finland Area standards. <br> 
   <br> 
Northern Pike catch rate would be considered slightly low compared to other similar lakes in the area.  However, average weight of 3.1 pounds is above average.  The largest fish sampled was 29.7 inches and weighed 6.6 pounds.  Natural reproduction appears consistent as six year classes were sampled.  Growth is somewhat slow by area standards. <br> 
 <br> 
Black Crappie were sampled for the first time in Comfort Lake in 2015.  The catch rate was average but the average weight of 0.75 pounds was above average. The largest fish sampled was 13.6 inches long and weighed 1.2 pounds.  Seven year classes were sampled with age-7 representing 35% of the catch.  Growth is slightly slow by Finland Area standards.  Anglers should try to show some restraint in harvest of large crappies, as fish over a pound are likely also over 10 years old and reproduction in this area is usually sporadic.   <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch catch rate is above average for similar lakes but the average weight of 0.1 pounds is below average.  The growth of perch is slow compared to other area lakes.  The largest fish sampled was 7.9 inches long.  <br> 
 <br> 
White Sucker catch rate was average for the Finland Area with the average weight of 2.2 pounds.  Other species sampled included Pumpkinseed, Golden Shiner, Iowa Darter, and Black Nose Shiner.  <br>

 Narrative = '<p>Cramer Lake is a 62 acre body of water located approximately 10 miles northeast of Finland, MN.  The maximum depth was 4 feet, with heavy aquatic vegetation over much of the lake.  Wild rice, dense enough for recreational harvest, was found in the north end and west side of the lake.  The lake access is a carry-down trail from Lake County Road #7 to the southeast shore.  There was parking for approximately two vehicles at the pull-off from the main road. <br> 
 <br> 
The secchi disk reading in 2010 was 3.2 feet in the brown, bog stained water.  Water quality measurements indicated Cramer Lake was a moderately hard-water infertile lake.  Muck and detritus were the most abundant substrates followed by boulder, rubble, gravel, sand.  Most of the firm substrate was found along the south and southeast shores.  Spawning habitat was rated "good" for northern pike, yellow perch and sunfish, with abundant aquatic vegetation present. <br> 
 <br> 
The fish sample in 2010 consisted of northern pike, pumpkinseed, white sucker and yellow perch.  Northern pike were sampled in above average numbers in 2010.  Average size was 1.8 pounds (19.1inches) with the largest northern pike measuring 30.4 inches. <br> 
   <br> 
The yellow perch numbers were about average for this type of lake.  The average size was 0.2 pound (7.3 inches) and the largest yellow perch was 10.5 inches. <br> 
   <br> 
Pumpkinseed sunfish are present in Cramer Lake but the average size was very small.  Ninety-six percent of the pumpkinseeds measured in 2010 were less than 5 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
There are many small lakes in the Finland area with fish communities similar to Cramer Lake, with a northern pike population sustained by a yellow perch/white sucker forage base.  While large numbers of large northern pike are unlikely in these small lakes, it is possible to catch enough northern pike for a meal and have a chance for the rare trophy fish. <br> 
 <br> 
Cramer Lake is lightly fished during the bulk of the year.  Early spring and early ice fishing are the most popular periods to fish this lake.      <br>

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/19/2010 Clarity: 12' 
 Narrative = '<p>Dam Five Lake is a 95 acre body of water located approximately 12 miles east-northeast of Isabella, MN.  There is a carry-down access to the south end of the lake from a short road off of Lake County Road # 7.  There is a camping site established in the general area of the public access, the open space has limited parking (4 vehicles).  Depending on the lake level, motoring up the narrow portion of the south end of the lake can be a problem with stumps and boulders.  The dam on the outlet washed out in 2001, dropping the lake level approximately 1.5 feet from the 2000 lake level, the lake level had dropped another 0.5 foot by 2003, held that level when measured in 2007 and was back to the 2001 level in this investigation (2010), when beaver activity re-established the lake level. <br> 
 <br> 
The lake has a maximum depth of 38 feet, 64 acres littoral, with a secchi disk reading of 12 feet in the brown, bog stained water.  Water quality indicated the lake was a moderately hard-water lake with low fertility.  Dissolved oxygen is lacking at depths greater than 16 feet, by early August.  The predominant substrate was muck ("common") with rubble, boulder, detritus, gravel and sand in order of abundance and rated "rare" over-all.  Spawning habitat was considered "poor" for walleye and northern pike, "fair" for largemouth bass and rated "good" for yellow perch. <br> 
 <br> 
The fish sample in 2010 consisted of largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed, walleye, white sucker and yellow perch.  Walleye were sampled in above average numbers for northeastern Minnesota lakes with similar characteristics.  The average size of the walleye sample was 0.8 pound (12.9 inches); the largest walleye was 19.3 inches.  Strong representation of the 2007 year-class (70% of the catch) brought the average walleye size down in 2010, although this year-class should produce good walleye fishing in the near future.  All walleye aged in 2010 were correlated to stocked year-classes 2009, 2007 and 2001; natural reproduction in Dam Five Lake appears to be minimal. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike were sampled in below average numbers for the lake class.    The northern pike average size was 1.3 pounds (17.5 inches); the largest northern pike was 27 inches.  Northern pike assessments on Dam Five Lake have been spotty, with a low number or sometimes no northern pike collected in standard sampling gear.  The lake level fluctuations since 2001, due to the outlet dam washout, has made spawning habitat for this species very limited. <br> 
 <br> 
A low number of small yellow perch were collected in 2010.  Dam Five Lake has a history of producing low numbers of yellow perch, rarely have quality size fish been sampled. <br> 
 <br> 
Adult largemouth bass were not collected in standard sampling gear in 2010; however, there were many young-of-the-year largemouth bass caught in small mesh trap nets indicating a reproducing largemouth bass population exists in Dam Five Lake.  Previous investigation sampled low numbers of adult largemouth bass, with most of them measuring  less than 10 inches in length. <br> 
 <br> 
Beaver activity on the outlet of Dam Five Lake has returned the lake to a level closer to the long-term norm.  Natural reproduction for all species will benefit having access to spawning areas/habitat that were not accessible for nearly ten years, this could produce more stable fish populations.  Walleye fingerlings will be stocked every-odd-year to supplement the limited natural reproduction. <br>

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/18/2014 Clarity: 10.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Katydid Lake is 20.9 acres, 100% littoral, with a maximum depth of 13 feet, and categorized as a lake class 14.  The lake is located eight miles east and two miles north of Isabella down the Wanless Road (FS 172) with the Cold Spring Quarry bordering on the east.  There is no developed access for the lake but the lake can be accessed by a 700 foot trail off FS 172 that is suitable for SUV type of vehicles.  There is a very small turn around area at the lake and parking for only one vehicle.  Trailers would need to be disconnected and turned around by hand in order to launch small boats.  From 1984 to 2007 the lake was used as a Walleye rearing pond.  Due to reports of recent angler activity on Katydid Lake, a lake survey was conducted in the summer of 2014 to assess the status of the fishery. <br> 
 <br> 
Katydid Lake has very soft water and has low fertility.  Twenty-seven species/groups of vegetation are present in Katydid Lake with the bog species of sweetgale, Labrador tea, and leatherleaf being the most common.  Floating and submerged vegetation within Katydid Lake is rare.  The substrate is mostly muck and detritus with some boulder, rubble, gravel.  There are small spots of sand close to shore.  One small inlet enters on the northwest shore and one outlet exits the lake on the southeast shore.  <br> 
 <br> 
The 2014 survey found a robust Walleye population in this little lake.  Walleye gill net catch and trap net was higher than average for similar lakes in the Finland Management Area.  Approximately 25% of the Walleye sampled were over 15 inches with the largest fish sampled at 21.34 inches and weighed 2.59 pounds.  While the mean weight of 1.18 pounds was average for the Finland Area, growth was faster than the area average.  Six year classes were sampled, three of which were from natural reproduction after the stocking ceased in 2007.  Apparently, Katydid Lake has a naturally reproducing Walleye population that might provide some angling opportunities to anglers with a small boat, canoe, or perhaps a float tube. <br> 
 <br> 
Other species sampled in the survey were Blacknose Shiner, Bluntnose Minnow, Fathead Minnow, Finescale Dace, Golden Shiner, Iowa Darter and Pearl Dace. <br>

 Narrative = '<p>Moose Lake is a remote 180 acres lake with a maximum depth of six feet, located approximately 11 miles northeast of Finland, MN.  Moose Lake is accessed by a remote trail (0.6 mile) from old logging roads to the west end of Moose Lake.  The route is not marked and unless familiar with the area could be difficult to follow.  The main tributaries on the northeast end of Moose Lake are Cabin Creek and Moose Creek. The outlet is Moose Creek, exiting the south end of Moose Lake, a tributary of the Manitou River in the Lake Superior North Watershed.  Moose Lake is a moderately soft water lake of low fertility with total alkalinity of 24 and total phosphorous of 0.016.  A Secchi disk was visible to the bottom in six feet of water, the maximum depth found.  Wild rice and floating-leaf burreed are scattered over most of the lake surface with a dense stand of wild rice in the northeast arm of the lake.  The north and south shores had clean gravel substrate out to about fifty feet from shore.   <br> 
 <br> 
The 2014 lake population assessment found Northern Pike, Walleye, Yellow Perch, White Sucker and Pumpkinseed Sunfish in Moose Lake.  Northern Pike were found in above average numbers for the lake class, the average size was 19.7 inches with 14 percent greater than 24 inches, the largest Northern Pike measured 32.7 inches (7.3 pounds).  Northern Pike and Yellow Perch were also present in Moose Lake in the initial 1977 lake survey. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye were found in Moose Lake for the first time in 2014, when a small number were caught in standard sampling gear.  The average size was 20.7 inches (3.8 pounds); however, one individual measuring 25.8 inches (7.3 pounds) greatly influenced the average size.  No fish stocking has been done on Moose Lake, the appearance of Walleye in the lake probably was the result of migration downstream from a nearby managed Walleye lake. <br> 
 <br> 
The Yellow Perch sampled in Moose Lake in 2014 averaged 7.5 inches with 38 percent of the sample greater than 8.0 inches the largest Yellow Perch measured was 11.6 inches.  Yellow Perch numbers were above average for this lake class, the abundant aquatic vegetation in the lake provides for good Yellow Perch spawning and a refuge from predators. <br>

It is approximately 26 miles northeast of Ely and is accessible by a 300 yard portage from Trader Lake.  The maximum depth on this 28 acre lake is 58 feet and the water color was light green at the time of this survey.  

Neglige Lake was thermally stratified on June 9, 2015 with a surface temperature of 64 F and a bottom temperature of 40 F.  Ample oxygen for trout was retained to a depth of 30 feet; the temperature was 41 F at this depth.  As in the past, this assessment found excellent water quality in Neglige Lake.  Although the water was light green, it still had very good clarity and a good oxygen profile.  Neglige is typical of lakes stocked with stream trout in the Ely Area, except that it is deeper and more fertile.  Most of the shoreline is rocky with some muck in the bays.  A fair amount of cedar has fallen into the water.  White cedar, spruce, and thick balsam fir line the edges of the lake.

Rainbow trout fingerlings were stocked annually from 1980 to 1988.  From 1989 to the present various strains of brook trout fingerlings have been annually stocked.  

The 2015 survey showed Neglige Lake had one of the highest trout catches of the 26 stream trout lakes in the Tower Fisheries Management Area. The average catch by weight of 23 lbs/net was second in the Tower Area but the number of fish caught was also high. 

The 41 brook trout caught were a range of sizes from 7 to 21 inches. The average size was 13 inches and 34% of the fish were larger than this. There were three general size groups around 7, 12, and 18 inches.

Sampling showed that trout fed mostly on insects, but also crayfish and minnows were being consumed.

Lake One has very soft and infertile water. The irregular shoreline is mostly boulder and there are few aquatic plants. The Kawishiwi River flows through Lake One. There is a rapids at the outlet that prevents upstream fish movement. <br> 
 <br> 
Nine gill nets and 12 trap nets were set on Lake One during the week of 6/6/16. Seven species of fish were sampled including bluegill, cisco, lake whitefish, northern pike, rock bass, walleye and white sucker. This was the first survey where no yellow perch were sampled. Two smallmouth bass were observed on spawing beds during the survey. There have been 6 previous surveys on Lake One with the most recent in 1996. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye numbers in 2016 (2.4/gill net) were below average compared to other similar lakes in the area and identical to the historic average for Lake One. The average walleye sampled was 12.7 inches long or about 5 years old which is slightly smaller than the historic average length of 14.1 inches. Walleye growth appears to be very slow on Lake One. The largest walleye sampled in 2016 was nearly 30 inches. <br>

There are two remote campsites maintained by the U.S. Forest Service on Scarp Lake.  The shoreline is generally steep, with an escarpment of rock in the middle of the south shore, therefore the lake name.  Rainbow trout management began in 1962; Scarp Lake was added to the designated stream trout lake list in 1965 affording the lake the protections those regulations provide.

Public access is a 0.25 mile trail from the parking area along the Trappers Lake Road (USFS Road 369) to the southwest end of the lake. The lake is surrounded by United States Forest Service land and the shoreline is comprised mainly of pines and cedar. The lake has an area of 19 acres with a maximum depth of 13 feet; on June 29, 2015 you could see to the bottom in light green stained water. The lake has moderately hard water of low fertility. Boulder and rubble are the most common bottom substrates followed by muck, decaying organic matter, gravel and a very limited amount of sand.  Vegetation was found growing to a depth of 11 feet with twenty species/groups of aquatic vegetation identified. Arrowhead Creek enters and exits the lake, is a designated trout stream and supports naturally reproducing populations of Brook Trout.   <br> 
 <br> 
The 2015 survey was completed to assess the status of natural reproduction in the lake after the discontinuation of Brook Trout stocking after 2007.  Brook Trout were stocked from 1963 until 2007.  <br> 
 <br> 
Brook Trout trap net catch in 2015 was slightly below average compared to other similar lakes in the Finland Area.  However, the catch was very similar of previous catch rates in Trappers Lake.  The average weight was a quarter pound and the largest fish sampled was 11.3 inches long.  Growth is slower than average by Finland Area standards. <br> 
 <br> 
White Suckers were caught in high numbers with small average size, as has been the case in all past assessments.  Common Shiners and Creek Chubs were also caught, but in low numbers. <br> 
 <br> 
Trappers Lake is a designated trout lake and as such, applicable rules apply.  The lake is very clear with sparse vegetation and some downed cedar along the south shore.  Much caution is advised in winter due to the inlet and springs; the lake is very susceptible to slush and at times there have been small open areas near the middle of the lake. <br>

The Kawishiwi River flows through Lake Two with a large flow. Fish may move freely through the inlet (from Lake Three and Lake Four), but rapids at the two outlets (both to Lake One) prevent upstream fish movement. Lake Two has very soft and infertile water and its shoreline drops off into deep water relatively quickly. The lake bottom near shore is mostly boulder and ledgerock, with small amounts of rubble, gravel, and muck. Aquatic plants are sparse. <br>

Greenleaf Lake is a 302 acre lake located approximately 3.5 miles southwest of the town of Montgomery in Le Sueur County. The DNR-owned public access is located on the northeast shore off of County Road 140. It has a maximum depth of 19 feet, with approximately 87% of the lake classified as littoral area. It is placed in Lake Class 38, which includes other Waterville Area lakes such as Ballantyne Lake (Blue Earth County), Bass Lake (Faribault County), Hunt Lake (Rice County), and Horseshoe Lake (Le Sueur County). Greenleaf Lake is primarily managed for Bluegill and Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie and Largemouth Bass. The management plan calls for stocking Walleye fry at a rate of 1,000 fish/littoral acre in odd years. Recent stocking events include a mix of fry, fingerlings, yearlings, and adults in 2011 and fry only in 2013 and 2015. Periodic winterkills were common before the installation of an aerator in 1983. Since that time, winterkills have not been a factor. High levels of phosphorus have contributed to poor water quality and extensive algae blooms that result in poor water quality. The lack of aquatic vegetation remains a challenge for managing stable game fish populations. Greenleaf Lake was surveyed the week of June 27, 2016 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by the Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying 6 gill nets and 7 trap nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill <br> 
A total of 67 Bluegills were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 9.6/net. Since 1984, catch rates have varied from 3.3/net in 1987 to 142.0/net in 2011 with an average of 34.2/net. Lengths ranged from 2.8 to 7.9 inches with an average of 3.9 inches. Fish ranged from 1 to 4 years old with 4 year-classes present. The 1 year old year-class accounted for approximately 88% of the sample. The lack of larger and older fish was concerning but the presence of a large age-1 year-class suggests that the Bluegill population will recover without interference. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye <br> 
A total of 26 Walleyes were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 4.3/net. Walleye numbers have increased in recent years and this represents the highest catch rate since 1984. Before 2013, catch rates averaged just 1.0/net. Lengths ranged from 10.1 to 23.1 inches with an average of 17.4 inches. Seven additional Walleyes ranging from 9.8 to 11.7 inches were sampled with trap nets. Fish from both gears ranged from 1 to 7 years old with 4 year-classes present. On average, fish reached 15.0 inches around 2 years old, indicating fast growth relative to other area lakes. Collectively, the 2013 and 2015 year-classes that represent fry-stocked years comprised 94% of the sample. Overall, fry stocking events in 2013 and 2015 appeared to be responsible for the increase in Walleye numbers in recent years.  <br> 
 <br> 
Black Crappie <br> 
Black Crappie numbers reached an all-time low in 2016 with 5 fish sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 0.8/net. Since 1984, catch rates have been erratic with 4 samples below 5.0/net and 4 samples above 40.0/net with an overall average of 28.7/net. Black Crappie populations are notoriously unstable and the wide range in catch rates collected from Greenleaf was considered typical. One 13.0 inch fish was 5 years old, indicating fast growth potential. That potential coupled with the displayed resilience in past surveys, suggests that the Black Crappie population will rebound without supplementation. <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth Bass <br> 
A boat electrofishing sample targeting Largemouth Bass was postponed until 2017 due to time constraints. Despite their ability to avoid capture in net gears, a total of 39 Largemouth Bass were sampled with gill and trap nets in 2016. Lengths ranged from 5.0 to 20.6 inches with an average of 10.0 inches. Fish from both gears ranged from 1 to 15 years old with 4 year-classes present. Only one fish was older than 3 years old. The electrofishing sample scheduled for 2017 will more effectively sample the Largemouth Bass population and likely provide a larger sample size to analyze. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch <br> 
Yellow Perch were the most common non-bullhead species sampled with gill nets in 2016. A total of 59 fish ranging from 4.6 to 9.6 inches were sampled for a catch rate of 9.9/net. Since 1984, Yellow Perch numbers have been unstable with 5 samples falling below 1.0/net and 5 samples exceeding 9.0/net with an overall average of 7.3/net. An additional 52 fish ranging from 4.2 to 6.2 inches were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 7.3/net. Yellow Perch remained an important prey species in Greenleaf Lake in 2016. <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
Black Bullhead <br> 
Black Bullheads dominated the gill and trap net catches in 2016. A total of 1,619 were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 269.8/net. Since 1984, catch rates have varied from 8.0/net in 1994 to 274.0/net in 1985 with an average of 103.1/net. Lengths ranged from 4.5 to 14.4 inches with an average of 7.2 inches. Black Bullheads thrive in unstable and hypereutrophic systems like Greenleaf Lake. Even with the aerator, the fish community will likely remain dominated by tolerant species such as Black Bullheads and Common Carp. <br> 
 <br> 
Common Carp <br> 
Common Carp were the second most abundant species in the gill nets. A total of 31 fish ranging from 7.5 to 26.5 inches were sampled for a catch rate of 5.2/net. Since 1984, catch rates have varied from 0.0/net in 1985 to 48.3/net in 2006 with an average of 13.0/net. Like Black Bullheads, Common Carp are adept at surviving in lakes like Greenleaf. To demonstrate this point, approximately 80% of the total weight of fish sampled with gill nets was Black Bullheads and Common Carp. Unfortunately efforts to reduce populations of Common Carp and Black Bullhead have largely been unsuccessful in lakes similar to Greenleaf. It is also possible that aeration allows them to remain at high numbers when they would otherwise suffer high losses during winterkills. <br> 
 <br> 
Other Species <br> 
The only other species sampled in 2016 was White Sucker. <br> 
 <br> 
Anglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> 
 <br> 
Shoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2013-07-22',  County Name = 'Le Sueur', Lake Name = 'Scotch' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/24/2013 Clarity: .75' 
 Narrative = '<p>Scotch Lake is a 565 acre lake located in Le Sueur County near the city of Cleveland.  A public access is located on the northwest side of the lake, just off 271st Avenue.  Scotch Lake is a eutrophic, shallow basin with a maximum depth of 11 feet.   <br> 
 <br> 
Scotch Lake was surveyed the week of July 22, 2013 as part of a regular monitoring program.  This survey consisted of deploying trap and gill nets to monitor the fish community.  Black bullheads and common carp were the most abundant fish species in the nets.  A total of 1,789.0 black bullhead were collected.  Black bullhead ranged in length from 4.0 to 9.0 inches, with an average length of 5.0 inches.  Black bullheads thrive in shallow lakes with high productivity, so their high abundance in Scotch Lake is expected.  Similarly, common carp abundance was high in 2013.  Common carp became re-established in recent years and have since increased in population.  Throughout the 2013 survey, 438.0 carp were collected in the nets compared to a total of 47.0 carp in 2009.   <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie, bluegill, and yellow perch were captured in low numbers during 2013.  Although black crappie abundance has increased since the last survey, the overall population status remained low in 2013.  A total of 57.0 black crappies were collected in the 2013 assessment, compared to 8.0 fish in 2009.  The length of black crappies averaged 8.0 inches, ranging from 7.0 to 10.5 inches.  Bluegill abundance in Scotch Lake continues to be low, with only 4.0 fish collected throughout the survey and averaging 5.6 inches in total length.  Yellow perch abundance has decreased in recent years, from 12.0 fish per gill net in 2009 to 0.0 fish in 2013.  Yellow perch adults were stocked in Scotch Lake in 2004. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike and walleye were the primary predator fish species observed during the 2013 survey.  Northern pike fry were stocked in Scotch Lake in 2006, 2008, 2009, and 2012.  The 2013 survey yielded 14.0 northern pike total, all of which were collected in trap nets.  Although low in abundance, the sizes of northern pike in Scotch Lake during 2013 were large ranging from 23.0 to 33.0 inches, with an average total length of 30.0 inches.  Although walleye abundance has remained relatively stable over the last decade, catch rates decreased in 2013.  From 2003-2009, gill nets averaged over 24.0 walleye/net.  However, the 2013 average was only 4.0 walleye/gill net.  The length of walleye ranged from 13.0 to 28.0 inches and averaged over 18.0 inches.  The average weight of walleye from gill nets was 2.6 pounds, which was above average for similar lakes in the area.  A walleye maintenance stocking program has been in place at Scotch Lake for years to sustain the population.  The most recent walleye fry stockings were in 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2013. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2009-07-27',  County Name = 'Lincoln', Lake Name = 'Dead Coon (Main Lake)' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/26/2009 Clarity: 1.4' 
 Narrative = '<p>Dead Coon is a 555-acre lake with a maximum depth of 9 feet and is located near the town of Arco in Lincoln County.  The lake is a class 43 lake and is managed for walleye primarily while yellow perch are managed secondarily.  As part of the Lake Survey on Dead Coon, vegetation transects were conducted to determine the presence or absence of aquatic emergent and submergent vegetation.  The only vegetation found during the survey was hardstem bulrush (Scirpus acutus) and that was only on 3% of the 29 transects. <br> 
 <br> 
The walleye population is doing very well in Dead Coon when compared to other lakes with similar morphology and water quality characteristics.  The gill net catch rate of 16.7 walleye/net was above our long range goal of 15.0 fish/net.  Lengths of walleye caught in our gill nets ranged from 11.1 to 26.9 inches with an average length of 15.2 inches.  Almost 50% of the walleye aged were from a 2007 year class when the lake wasn't stocked.  This could indicate excellent natural reproduction but it could also be the result of fry drift from Benton where 2.8 million fry were stocked in 2007. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch numbers are what we would expect for lakes similar to Dead Coon.  There were some very nice yellow perch caught in our nets during the 2009 survey.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in our gill nets ranged from 9.0 to 12.1 inches and had an average length of 10.5 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
The northern pike population appears to be increasing according to data collected during the 2009 survey.  The northern pike trap net catch rate increased from 0.1 fish/net in 2005 to 0.8 fish/net in 2009.  Lengths of northern caught in our trap nets ranged from 14.1 to 24.9 inches with an average length of 20.1 inches.  Only one northern pike was sampled in gill nets; however, it had a total length of 40.2 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Black bullhead numbers were quite low during the survey in 2009.  High walleye numbers in Dead Coon throughout the last 15 years may have suppressed the black bullhead population and is keeping black bullhead numbers in check.  Black bullhead sampled in trap and gill nets in 2009 were large.  Lengths of black bullhead caught in our trap nets ranged from 12.5 to 13.4 inches and had an average length of just under 13 inches.  The only black bullhead caught in gill nets was 13.1 inches in length. <br> 
 <br> 
Other fish sampled during the 2009 lake survey included orange spotted sunfish, carp, and white sucker. <br> 
 <br> 
To maintain a healthy fishery in Dead Coon Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMPs) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br>

 Narrative = '<p>     Popowski Lake is located four miles north and two miles east of Ivanhoe in Lincoln County.  Popowski is approximately 140 acres and does not contain a public boat ramp.  A large portion of the lake lies within the boundaries of a State Wildlife Management Area (WMA) and is subject to WMA regulations. <br> 
     Historically Popowski was a high quality waterfowl lake with shallow, clear water and abundant vegetation.  During the past 30 years Popowski's depth increased from two to 12 feet.  Its water clarity declined and dense phytoplankton blooms have frequently occurred. <br> 
     Walleye were abundant in 2012 with most fish measuring 14 or 20 inches.  Walleye growth has been good with fish reaching 14 inches after only two summers.  Yellow perch were abundant with many fish present from 5-13 inches.  Both species have experienced very sporadic, but at times very good, recruitment.  Black bullhead were abundant but somewhat small with most fish less than eight inches.  Black crappie and largemouth bass were not caught in 2012, although they were present during the last assessment conducted in 2001. <br>

 Survey Date = '2014-09-08',  County Name = 'Lincoln', Lake Name = 'Slough' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 09/08/2014 Clarity: 5' 
 Narrative = '<p>INTRODUCTION <br> 
Slough Lake (West Dead Coon) is a 162.0-acre located 3.5 miles to the southeast of the City of Arco in Lincoln County. Historically, Slough Lake was a wetland, but water levels began to increase in the mid-1980's, similar to other lakes in that area (Lake Wilson, Wood, and East Twin). Since the increase in water level, Slough Lake has a maximum depth of 13.0 feet and has decent water quality with a secchi depth of 5.0 feet in September of 2014. Slough Lake is managed primarily for yellow perch and secondarily for walleye and black crappie. Slough Lake has not been stocked since 2003, when adult walleyes were stocked. Boat access to the lake is through the Wildlife Management Area on the northwest side, but is difficult because it is not concrete and is shallow. A population assessment was conducted the week of September 9, 2014 to monitor fish populations in Slough Lake.  <br> 
 <br> 
YELLOW PERCH <br> 
In the initial survey in 2002, yellow perch were captured at a rate of 302.5 per gill net. In 2014, yellow perch were captured at a rate of 24.0 per gill net, which is more realistic, given that the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes is 2.7 to 25.0 per gill net. Yellow perch were small as lengths ranged from 6.3 to 8.6 inches and averaged 7.6 inches. Yellow perch were plump, indicating that forage is abundant. Yellow perch have not been stocked in Slough Lake by the MNDNR, so this appears to be a naturally reproducing population that is able to sustain itself. <br> 
 <br> 
WALLEYE <br> 
A population of walleye continues to be present in Slough Lake despite not being stocked since 2003. A catch rate of 1.5 per gill net was observed during the initial survey in 2002. In 2014, the walleye catch rate increased significantly to 8.0 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net). Walleye ages were estimated from otoliths. Five year classes of walleye were sampled including 2013 (age-1), 2011 (age-3), 2009 (age-5), 2008 (age-6) and 2007 (age-7) which means that some degree of natural reproduction is occurring or walleye are being illegally stocked, as it is very unlikely that fish can get into Slough Lake from Dead Coon Lake. Growth of walleye in Slough Lake was similar to growth observed in other class 43 lakes, with mean back calculated lengths at age being 9.3 inches at age-1, 13.5 inches at age-2, 16.1 inches at age-3, 18.4 inches at age-4, 20.2 inches at age-5, 21.2 inches at age-6, and 21.3 inches at age-7. Lengths of walleyes caught in gill nets ranged from 12.7 to 27.6 inches and averaged 22.5 inches, and in trap nets ranged from 6.0 to 25.4 inches and averaged 17.6 inches. Black bullheads and yellow perch account for much of the walleye forage base in Slough Lake. It appears that Slough Lake supports a fishable walleye population.  <br> 
 <br> 
BLACK CRAPPIE <br> 
Three black crappie were sampled during the 2014 survey, marking the first time that they have been sampled in a survey on Slough Lake. The black crappie were small, ranging from 3.0 to 3.8 inches in length. Black crappie appear to occur at a very low abundance in Slough Lake.  <br> 
 <br> 
BLACK BULLHEAD <br> 
Abundance of black bullhead has remained stable since the initial survey in 2002 (138.0 per gill net), as black bullhead were captured at a rate of 169.5 per gill net in 2014. The 2014 catch rate is above the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (30.3 to 150.6 per gill net). Black bullhead ranged in length from 5.8 to 10.3 inches and averaged 9.0 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
OTHER SPECIES <br> 
One bluegill was captured in a trap net, marking the first time that this species has been documented in Slough Lake. The bluegill was likely illegally introduced by an angler.  <br> 
  <br> 
Although not sampled in the survey, reports of channel catfish being caught at Slough Lake were received during the spring of 2014, with one of the channel catfish being caught by a MNDNR Fisheries staff member. Again, channel catfish were likely illegally introduced by an angler. To avoid unintended introductions, anglers should be diligent about disposing of unused bait in the trash, and should report unpermitted movement of fish.  <br> 
 <br> 
Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> 
 <br> 
Best management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake. High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality. Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br>

 Narrative = '<p>Steep Bank Lake is located in Lincoln County five miles northeast of Hendricks.  It measures 208 acres and has a maximum depth of 7 feet.  It is a highly productive lake that frequently experiences dense algae blooms and is prone to winterkill.  Winterkills occurred during the winters of 1980-81, 1981-82, 1993-94, 2000-01, and 2008-09.  A 2012 moderate to severe summerkill also occurred in 2012. <br> 
 <br> 
Steep Bank Lake is managed as a boom or bust walleye fishery.  Walleye are maintained by fry stocking as spawning success by them has been poor.  Walleye were abundant in 2014 with 20 caught per gill net.  The majority were 9-19 inches and from the 2013 and 2011 year classes.  Walleye fry were stocked during spring, however survival was likely poor because young-of-year walleye were not very abundant during the fall. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch were abundant and they were 5-7 inches long.  They were growing very well and should measure 9-10 inches during 2015. <br>

 Survey Date = '2014-06-16',  County Name = 'Lyon', Lake Name = 'Yankton' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/17/2014 Clarity: .8' 
 Narrative = '<p>INTRODUCTION <br> 
Yankton Lake is a 387-acre lake located in the City of Balaton in Lyon County. Yankton Lake has a maximum depth of 8.0 feet, and a watershed to lake ratio of 3 to 1. Despite having a small watershed, Yankton Lake's water quality is poor with a secchi depth of 0.8 ft in 2014 and heavy algae blooms and turbid water throughout much of the year. An aeration system was installed in 1983, and since, severe winterkill has not been documented. Yankton Lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for northern pike, crappie, and yellow perch. To maintain the walleye population, walleye fry are stocked two out of three years (2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2018). Populations of yellow perch, crappie, and northern pike are sustained primarily through natural reproduction, as stocking of these species has not occurred except for the northern pike fingerling stocking in 2008. A population assessment was conducted during the week of June 16, 2014 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and nine trap nets.  <br> 
 <br> 
WALLEYE <br> 
The 2014 walleye catch rate of 8.3 per gill net is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net), but is the lowest walleye catch rate that has been documented for Yankton Lake. Prior to 2014, catch rates varied from 10.2 per gill net in 1998 to 24.0 per gill net in 2002 and have averaged 14.2 per gill net since 1985. Size structure of the population was stable walleye ranged in length from 7.8 to 27.6 inches and averaged 18.6 inches. Six year classes of walleye were sampled including year classes from 2013 (age-1), 2012 (age-2), 2011 (age-3), 2009 (age-5), 2008 (age-6), and 2003 (age-11), all of which correspond to walleye fry stocking events, except for the 2013 year class, which is likely the result of natural reproduction. Mean back-calculated lengths at age for walleye were 8.9 inches at age-1, 12.6 inches at age-2, 15.7 inches at age-3, and 17.8 inches at age-4, indicating relatively slow growth when compared to walleye growth from similar lakes. Walleye were plump, suggesting that ample forage is available in Yankton Lake. Yankton Lake's walleye population appears to be stable as multiple year classes and lengths are present. Although the walleye catch rate is below the desired level (12.0 per gill net), it appears that the fry stocking in 2014 was successful, as near shore survey conducted on July 3, 2014 sampled 40 age-0 walleye. If the 2014 year class recruits to the fishery, the walleye catch rate should increase as these fish become vulnerable to the sampling gear. The current walleye fry stocking regime of 2 out of 3 years should continue as it is effective at maintaining multiple year classes in the population.  <br> 
 <br> 
NORTHERN PIKE <br> 
Catch rates of northern pike in Yankton Lake have varied from 0.8 per gill net in 1994 to 9.0 per gill net in 2002 and have averaged 3.0 per gill net since 1985. The 2014 catch rate of 4.3 per gill net is the second highest catch rate observed on Yankton Lake, and is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.1 to 8.0 per gill net). Northern pike fingerlings were last stocked in 2008, indicating that the northern pike population is maintained primarily through natural reproduction. Several wetlands are present around Yankton Lake, which can provide high quality northern pike spawning habitat if water levels are high enough to connect Yankton Lake to these wetlands. Northern pike ranged in length from 16.4 to 30.5 inches and averaged 21.3 inches. Northern pike were plump, indicating that northern pike are foraging successfully in Yankton Lake. The northern pike population appears to be somewhat stable, as it is comprised of multiple year classes and a wide range of lengths.  <br> 
 <br> 
YELLOW PERCH <br> 
Yellow perch catch rates have been highly variable in Yankton Lake, ranging from 2.6 per gill net in 1990 to 33.0 per gill net in 2002, and averaging 13.6 per gill net since 1985. In 2014 yellow perch were captured at a rate of 4.3 per gill net which is the second lowest yellow perch catch rate observed on Yankton Lake, but is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net). The population is sustained through natural reproduction, as evidenced by the capture of 17 YOY yellow perch during a July, 3, 2014 near shore survey. This suggests that adequate brood stock exists to maintain the yellow perch population. Yellow perch were small, ranging from 5.1 to 10.4 inches, with 92 percent of them being less than 6.0 inches in length.  <br> 
 <br> 
BLACK CRAPPIE <br> 
Black crappie catch rates have steadily declined in Yankton Lake since 1994. Trap net catch rates in 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010, and 2014 were 63.3 per trap net, 33.4 per trap net, 24.4 per trap net, 19.0 per trap net, 6.8 per trap net, and 1.9 per trap net, respectively. Black crappie recruitment tends to be highly variable and cyclic, with strong year classes reoccurring every three to five years. Populations are often comprised of one or two strong year classes because of this cyclic recruitment. Within the last couple of decades, Yankton Lake's black crappie population has not been able to produce the strong year classes typical of other crappie populations. The lack of a strong year class in recent years, and inconsistent recruitment has likely contributed to the decline of the crappie population in Yankton Lake. There appears to be at least three year classes present in Yankton Lake's crappie population, including YOY black crappie sampled in the July near shore survey (age-0; N=29), black crappie from 4.0 to 5.5 inches in length (age-1; N=5), and black crappie from 10.0 to 12.6 inches in length (age-4 plus; N=12); however, there are missing year classes, and the year classes that are present appear to be relatively weak. Black crappies were plump, suggesting that ample forage exists in Yankton Lake.  <br> 
 <br> 
OTHER SPECIES  <br> 
Black bullhead abundance has varied from 0.0 per gill net in 2010 to 122.0 per gill net in 1985. In 2014, bullheads were captured at a rate of 103.7 per gill net and 14.2 per trap net, both within expected ranges of catch rates for similar lakes. Lengths of black bullheads ranged from 4.6 to 11.3 inches and averaged 7.7 inches. With low numbers of yellow perch present in Yankton Lake, the black bullhead should provide a good forage base for the walleye population.  <br> 
 <br> 
Common carp numbers remained stable from the 2010 assessment (6.3 per gill net), with a catch rate of 5.7 per gill net in 2014. Common carp lengths ranged from 8.0 to 29.9 inches and averaged 16.0 inches. Fifty-nine percent of common carp sampled were less than 10.0 inches in length.  <br> 
 <br> 
The 2014 catch rate of bigmouth buffalo was 11.0 per gill net, which is the second highest catch rate observed on Yankton Lake. All of the buffalo sampled were between 6.5 and 8.4 inches, likely all from the same year class. Young-of-the-year buffalo (N=910) were also sampled in the July 3, 2014 near shore survey, indicating that 2014 year class is abundant.  <br> 
Other species sampled included white sucker and yellow bullhead.  <br> 
 <br> 
Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> 
 <br> 
Best management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake. High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality. Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2015-07-20',  County Name = 'Mahnomen', Lake Name = 'Island' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/20/2015 Clarity: 7.9' 
 Narrative = '<p>Island Lake is a 616-acre lake located in Mahnomen County approximately seven miles south of Lengby, MN.  The shoreline is heavily developed, with 188 homes or cabins and a former resort. Emergent beds of bulrush and cattail are scattered around the shoreline, although many historical beds have been eliminated in heavily developed areas. Island Lake has been identified as a class 25 lake, but it does not fit the general profile of some other class 25 lakes that are deeper and clearer. The lake is fertile and often experiences heavy summer algal blooms.  Island Lake is classified as eutrophic with a Carlson's trophic state index of 55.   <br> 
 <br> 
No severe winterkills have been formally documented for Island Lake. However, surveys indicate the lake experienced winterkill prior to 1953.  As a result, bullheads and Yellow Perch dominated 1953 net catches, with some Northern Pike and White Sucker also present.  These winterkill-resistant species comprised the fish community at that time, even though old stocking records indicate that centrarchids (Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass) and Walleye had been stocked prior to 1953.  Dissolved oxygen samples in early spring of 2013 and 2014 detected levels near or below 2 ppm, suggesting some winterkill is possible in isolated areas of the lake during severe winters.   <br> 
 <br> 
Fish stocking of Island Lake began in 1908, and has included sunfish, suckers, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Walleye. Currently, Walleye is the only species that continues to be stocked and has consisted of a variety of sizes and ages.  Walleye spawning habitat is extremely limited, and any natural reproduction that occurs is likely negligible.   <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye abundance has been quite variable in Island Lake.  The 2015 gill net catch was 7.7 per net, which was above the Island Lake historic mean of 6.1 per net.  Walleyes up to 10 years old were sampled, but 42% were attributed to the 2011 year class. Gill netted Walleye ranged in size from 9.1 inches to 27.1 inches long with an average length of 16.0 inches.  Walleye growth remains good with fish reaching an average length of 14.4 inches by four years old. <br> 
 <br> 
Gill net catch for Northern Pike was 11.6 per net in 2015, which is near the historical record.  Northern Pike spawning habitat is somewhat limited, particularly in low water years. However, recent high water levels have likely contributed to increased Northern Pike numbers as a result of greater spawning habitat availability. The 2011 and 2012 year classes comprised 69% of the Northern Pike sample. Average length of Northern Pike captured in gill nets was 22.3 inches, and ranged from 14.5 inches to 33.9 inches. An ample prey base of Yellow Perch likely supports the Northern Pike population in Island Lake, and Northern Pike growth rates were typical for this lake at 22.8 inches long by four years of age. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch catch rates have historically been high in Island Lake with an average catch rate of 74.5 per gill net.  The 2015 gill net catch rate of 44.4 per net was the third lowest in Island Lake's history, but still well above the normal catch for similar lakes in the state.  Lengths of Yellow Perch captured by gill nets in 2015 ranged from 4.0-10.0 inches with an average length of 7.0 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill trap net catches in 2015 averaged 20.5 per net, which is above average for Island Lake. Bluegills caught in trap nets had an average length of  6.5 inches, and ranged in size from 3.7 inches to 9.0 inches. Twenty-five of the 246 Bluegills captured in trap nets in 2015 were over 8 inches. Bluegill growth rates in 2015 were similar to historic lake averages with four-year-old Bluegills reaching 5.7 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
Black Crappie trap net catch in 2015 was the highest on record at 23.4 per net, which is well above both the Island Lake average and that of similar lakes in the state. Average length of trap netted Black Crappie was 5.9 inches, and ranged in size from 3.3-11.1 inches. Twenty-five of the 280 Black Crappie captured in trap nets in 2015 were over 10 inches long.  Black Crappie growth rates in 2015 were similar to historic lake averages with fish reaching 9.1 inches long by four years of age. Fifty-six percent of sampled Black Crappies were attributed to the 2014 year class. <br> 
 <br> 
With continuing shoreline and watershed development, this productive and valuable fishery will need help on several fronts to be sustained.  Anglers can help to maintain balance in fish populations by voluntarily releasing a portion of medium and large fish and keeping smaller ones for eating.  This is particularly true for Northern Pike and Bluegill.  Shoreline owners and other watershed dwellers can help to maintain or improve water quality and fish habitat by leaving shoreline buffer zones, by leaving stands of native aquatic vegetation intact, by taking precautions to prevent invasive species introductions, and by using wise land management practices.</p>'

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2005-07-05',  County Name = 'Mahnomen', Lake Name = 'Little Vanose' 
 Lake Clarity = '' 
 Narrative = '<p>This small lake has a history of occasional winterkill and blue-green algal blooms.  As in most winterkill lakes, black bullheads are the dominant fish species.  However, Little Vanose can also provide good fishing for walleye, northern pike, bluegills, and, more recently, black crappie in-between winterkills.In 2005, test net catches showed near normal populations of northern pike and black bullhead compared to other class 39 lakes.  Walleye catches were modest and all those caught were from the same 2003 year-class, which was stocked after the most recent partial winterkill.  Black crappies were more abundant than during any previous survey.  Most were small with and average length 6.5 inches and young at two to three years, but a few larger crappies were also found.  Barring another winterkill in the near future, crappie fishing should be very good in another two to three years, when the majority of black crappie should reach one-half pound.Walleye fry are stocked every other year and in years after winterkill.  The near future of the walleye fishery in Little Vanose hinges not only on winterkill, but also on the abundant black crappie.  In lakes similar to this one, black crappies are believed to be a major predator on small walleyes and abundances of crappie can result in declines in walleye numbers.</p>' 


2018-01-26 08:30:13.272
INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2014-07-07',  County Name = 'Mahnomen', Lake Name = 'South Twin' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/07/2014 Clarity: 7.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>South Twin Lake has a diverse fish community of warmwater species like Largemouth Bass and Bluegill, coolwater species like Northern Pike and Walleye, and coldwater species like Tullibee (Cisco).  Despite possible increases in angling pressure and increased shoreline development, the fishery in South Twin remains relatively good with strong populations of Northern Pike, Walleye, panfish, and Largemouth Bass. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike were generally young and small, averaging just under 19 inches, but a good range of sizes up to 32 inches were present.  In 2014, there was an abundant number of pike from the 2011 year class.  These young fish should provide good angling opportunites in coming years. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye spawning habitat is limited in South Twin.  During the late 1990's, conditions appeared favorable for providing additional Walleye angling by increasing stocking rates in this lake.  Walleye stocking rates were increased in 2000 and again in 2004 to take advantage of the abundant Yellow Perch forage base and the decreased numbers of Northern Pike in the lake at that time.  Since then, test net catches of Yellow Perch have declined substantialy along with an increase in Northern Pike catches.  In 2014, three to five-year-old Walleyes were most abundant and should provide good angling in the near future.  However, several older fish were also sampled. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegills grow slowly in South Twin and it appears most are caught before reaching the age of six years.  Consequently, Bluegills over eight inches in length are rare.  Black Crappie net catches increased since 2009 and crappies were also generally young.  However, crappies tend to grow fairly rapidly in this lake. <br> 
 <br> 
Minnesota's Pollution Control Agency (PCA) classifies South Twin Lake as mesotrophic (a middle-aged lake).  Lakeshore and watershed property owners can help to slow the aging of the lake (eutrophication) by using land management practices including (1) exceeding setbacks for structures and septic systems, (2) leaving buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shoreline, (3) leaving vegetation stands (especially bulrush and cattail) intact, and (4) not fertilizing lawns or using phosphorus free fertilizers. <br> 
 <br> 
In addition, South Twin was added to the list of Minnesota lakes included in the "Sentinel Lakes" program in 2008.  These lakes will receive additional testing for biological, physical, and chemical parameters in coming years in attempt to signal any trends in the state's lakes due to climate and other changes.</p>'

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2016-08-08',  County Name = 'Mahnomen', Lake Name = 'Tulaby' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/08/2016 Clarity: 3' 
 Narrative = '<p>Tulaby Lake is a 832-acre, class-27 lake on the Mahnomen County - Becker County line.  The lake lies in a scenic setting with a surrounding landscape that is predominantly forested and is within the boundaries of the White Earth Indian Reservation.  The lake's littoral area is 281 acres and the maximum depth is 43 feet.  This lake is categorized as early eutrophic with a mean Carlson's trophic state index in the lower fifties.  Tulaby Lake is generally known as a good fishing lake for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish that occasionally has brief periods of exceptionally good Walleye fishing. <br> 
 <br> 
The Northern Pike gill net catch rate has been stable over the past 20 years, but indicating a slight decline in recent surveys.  In 2016, this catch rate was 4.1 fish per gill net.  This rate is just slightly below the historical mean of 4.6 fish per set.  Thirty-three Northern Pike were sampled in 2016 with ages ranging from two to five years old.  Most (91%) of the Northern Pike were age 2 or 3. The overall mean length was 23.4 inches and fish were capatured from from 23.4 to 29.5 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
The historical gill net catch for Walleye in Tulaby Lake has seen peaks in catch rates when fisheries surveys first began and again in the most recent surveys.  The 2016 gill net catch of 25.1 fish per net was higher than those reported on all but the first (1959) survey, and above the long-term mean of 15.3 Walleyes per net.  Captured Walleyes ranged from one to 12 years of age.  Similar to the 2009 survey, age-3 Walleyes dominated the age frequency of sampled Walleye in 2016.  These age-3 Walleyes correspond to a year when fingerling Walleye were stocked and averaged 14.8 inches in length at the time of capture in early August.  The mean length of all sampled Walleyes was 15.4 inches and they ranged from 7.4 to 24.5 inches.   <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch gill net catch rates in Tulaby Lake have always been far above the typical range expected for a lake of this ecological type.  A historical low point of 62.7 fish per net in 1996 was still higher than expected for a lake of this type.  The 2016 gill net catch rate was very near the lakes historical average, which is an incredible 150.8 fish per net.  The mean length of Yellow Perch was 7.2 inches and they ranged in length from 3.4 to 10.3 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
The historic Bluegill trap net catch rate for Tulaby Lake is quite low at 14.2 per net.  The highest catch rate during this survey at 77.4 fish per net.  Prior to the survey in 2016, the historic mean catch rate was 7.2 fish per net.  Ages of the sampled Bluegills ranged from two to ten years, but 75% of them were ages 2 and 3.  The overall mean Bluegill length was 4.8 inches, but bluegills up to 9.6 inches were captured. <br> 
 <br> 
Other fish species sampled in Tulaby Lake included Black Crappie, Brown Bullhead, hybrid sunfish, Green Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, Cisco, Yellow Bullhead, and White Sucker.  Other than Cisco and White Sucker, which were relatively abundant, catch rates were modest for most of these species.  The trap net catch rate for Largemouth Bass in 2016 was 5.6 fish per net, but 93% of the sampled fish were less than 7.5 inches in length.  Bullhead trap net catches in recent surveys (including this one) have been well below what they were in the 1980's and before. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2011-08-29',  County Name = 'Martin', Lake Name = 'Amber' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/29/2011 Clarity: 1.3' 
 Narrative = '<p>Amber Lake is a 180 acre lake of which 108 are less than 15 feet (littoral zone).  Amber Lake is part of the" Fairmont Chain of Lakes" and is within the city limits of Fairmont.  The Fairmont Chain of Lakes (from headwaters to mouth) is comprised of Amber Lake, Hall Lake, Budd Lake, Sisseton Lake, and George Lake which are all natural impoundments of Center Creek in the Blue Earth River Watershed.  Amber Lake is the first lake and one of the deepest of the lakes with a watershed-to-lake ratio of 59 indicating a large influence of the watershed effects in the lake.  The city of Fairmont operates a storm water runoff system that empties into the lakes and the city also draws drinking water from Budd Lake, so it is imperative to reduce negative influences of water impairments in the watershed to improve the water quality in the Fairmont Chain of Lakes.   Martin County Soil and Water Conservation District has taken the lead on this and has implemented some projects that help reduce the effects of water quality impairments on the lake, but more can be done to virtually eliminate all influences through best management practices in the watershed.  Fish community changes over time tell us a lot about the health of an aquatic environment and its water quality.  Amber Lake is a class 24 lake and is managed primarily for walleye while crappie, yellow perch and channel catfish are managed secondarily.  Fish population assessments have been conducted every 4 to 6 years since 1982 with an initial assessment conducted in 1971.  A recent fish population assessment was conducted during the week of August 29, 2011 to analyze the current management of species in Hall Lake and to determine changes in the fish community over time.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
The walleye catch rate in Amber Lake was 3.0 fish per gill net, within the normal range of 1.2 to 6.3 fish per gill net.  Historically, the long term gill net catch rate was 3.4 fish per gill net with the catch exceeding that only 3 times (1971=12.8, 1982=3.5, 1987=5.0) in the past 8 fish population assessments.  The 2011 trap net catch rate was 1.4 fish per trap net, exceeding the normal range of 0.3 to 1.2 per trap net.  Historically, the trap net catch rate average of 0.9 fish per net has been exceeded 4 times (1987=1.1, 1993=1.6, 1997=2.1, and 2011=1.4) in the past 8 fish population assessments.  Trap net catch rates are not good indicators of walleye abundance, therefore gill net catch rates are used to assess the population.  The sizes of walleye were dominated by smaller sized fish (less than 15 inches).  The average length of walleye in the gill net sample was 12.5 inches with a range in length of 9.7 to 16.1 inches.  The walleye sampled were likely from a 2008 fingerling stocking.  The average length of age-3 fish was 12.2 inches, which is fair to poor growth for a walleye population in a southern Minnesota lake.  The overall condition of the walleye in the sample was fair to poor for walleye in August in a southern Minnesota lake.  Several factors are most likely responsible for the low walleye catch rate, size structure, and condition.  First, there are many species of fish in the Fairmont Chain of Lakes; in 2011 there were 14 species of fish caught in the gill nets and trap nets.  Many species can lead to competition for resources, particularly food.  Competition with freshwater drum and black crappie is common for walleye, especially the competition between walleye and black crappie.  Another factor is a possible decrease in the food supply of walleye through water quality changes.  The Fairmont Chain of Lakes has been treated in the past with copper sulfate to decrease algae blooms, the negative effect of copper sulfate that is often overlooked is an alteration of the food web due to invertebrate reduction leading to forage fish reductions.  This alteration can last for a long period of time due to copper as a heavy metal that accumulates in the sediment of the lake and is not easily removed.  The current fish population assessment does show the greatest abundance of walleye since 1987 so the population may be making a comeback.  Fishing success for walleye should increase in the next 2 to 3 years due to this increase and due to stocking of walleye fingerling in 2011 and 2012.    <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
The yellow perch catch rate was 39.0 fish per gill net and 1.8 fish per trap net, both exceeding the normal ranges for gill nets (2.0 to 27.9 per gill net) and trap nets (0.3 to 1.7 per trap net).  The average length of yellow perch in the gill nets and trap nets was 7.4 inches with a range in length from 4.9 to 8.9 inches.  The length of yellow perch caught in the sample indicating a population that is dominated by fish in the 5 to 8 inch range.  Overall, it appears that the yellow perch population is on the rise, as the population is dominated by younger and smaller individuals, and the population size structure will continue to improve.  The opportunity to catch 8 to 10 inch yellow perch in Amber Lake should be good, if not excellent, in the next 2 to 3 years.    <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
Two species of crappie (white and black) have been caught in Amber Lake since 1971.  The historical white crappie catch rate average is 1.0 per gill net and 3.5 per trap net and the historical black crappie catch rate is 7.3 fish per gill net and 20.4 per trap net.  In 2011, no white crappies were caught in gill nets or trap nets.  However, the 2011 black crappie catch rates were 15.0 fish per gill net and 35.1 fish per trap net exceeding the long-term average.  The normal catch rate ranges for black crappie are 2.5 to 16.5 fish per gill net and 1.8 to 21.2 fish per trap net.  The 2011 gill net catch rate is within the normal range and the trap net catch rate exceeds the normal range.  The size structure of the black crappie in the sample was above average indicating a population of black crappie dominated by fish in the 8 to 10 inch length group.  The average length of black crappie in the gill net and trap net samples was 8.4 inches with a range of 5.8 to 10.0 inches indicating an abundance of 2 or 3 consecutive year classes.  The overall condition of the black crappie in the sample was average for an August sample and indicated a population that is foraging successfully.  Amber Lake is poised to be a black crappie hotspot in the next 2 to 3 years as almost 30% of all fish caught in the 2011 fish population assessment were black crappie.       <br> 
  <br> 
 <br> 
Channel catfish are also managed in Amber Lake.  The gill net catch rate in 2011 was 3.3 fish per net, with a long-term average of 1.2 indicating an adequate population of channel catfish reside in Amber Lake.  The size structure of the channel catfish in the sample was balanced; the average length of channel catfish in the gill net and trap net sample was 12.7 and 12.9 inches respectively with a range in length from 7.5 to 21.1 inches.  The overall condition of the channel catfish in the sample was low for August, indicating some stress with respect to foraging ability.  Overall, it appears that the channel catfish population is maintaining itself at a low abundance.  Channel catfish fishing in Amber Lake will continue to be hit-or-miss with several caught here-and-there given the low abundance.   <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
Other non-managed species caught in the gill nets and trap nets were bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead, bluegill, common carp, freshwater drum, largemouth bass, northern pike, quillback carpsucker, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.  Amber Lake is a unique lake in southern Minnesota because of its species diversity and general characteristics of deeper than usual water for the area.  In addition to fishing, Amber Lake is a destination for recreational watercraft users.  Regardless, in order to preserve the unique features of Amber Lake all watercraft entering and exiting Amber Lake should remove aquatic vegetation and drain all water to reduce the chance of spreading harmful invasive species. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2015-06-08',  County Name = 'Martin', Lake Name = 'Bright' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/08/2015 Clarity: .2' 
 Narrative = '<p>INTRODUCTION <br> 
 <br> 
Bright Lake is a 645-acre lake located 2.5 miles northeast of the Town of Ceylon in Martin County.  The basin is relatively shallow, with a maximum depth of 6.0 feet observed during the survey, and a shoreline length of 4.4 miles.  A thick band of cattails is present around the perimeter of the lake, with some bulrush present.  The ample emergent vegetation provides spawning and nursery habitat for several species of fish.  Because of its shallowness and susceptibility to winterkill, Bright Lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike and secondarily for Yellow Perch, both of which can tolerate relatively low dissolved oxygen levels.  Fish populations maintain themselves naturally, as stocking hasn't occurred on Bright Lake since 2003.  Bright Lake's connection to other lakes and wetlands (Okamanpeedan, Pierce, Clayton, and Little Tuttle) allows movement of fish among the waterbodies, likely aiding in maintaining fish populations.  Because of this connectivity to the East Fork of the Des Moines Watershed, rough fish populations such as common carp, bigmouth buffalo, and black bullhead have persisted in this system of lakes.  Bright Lake was surveyed the week of June 8, 2015 to monitor fish populations using 11 trap nets.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
NORTHERN PIKE <br> 
 <br> 
The system of lakes, wetlands, and streams around Ceylon, MN, of which Bright Lake is included, has historically been a favorable system for northern pike production.  Excellent Northern Pike spawning habitat exists throughout the system.  The 2015 Northern Pike catch rate of 3.6 per trap net reflected these favorable conditions, as this was the second highest Northern Pike catch rate observed on Bright Lake and was higher than expected catch rates for similar lakes.  Catch rates have varied from 0.3 per trap net in 1999 to 4.5 per trap net in 1994, and have averaged 2.2 per trap net since 1989.  Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 10.8 to 33.0 inches and averaged 18.1 inches.  Nearly every inch category between 10 and 33 was represented in the sample, indicating that natural reproduction is consistent in Bright Lake or the system of waterbodies connected to Bright Lake.  Northern Pike were healthy but not plump.  It appears that there is plenty of forage in Bright Lake including Bigmouth Buffalo, Common Carp, White Crappie, and Yellow Perch; however, the poor water quality may prevent Northern Pike from successfully foraging on the abundant prey fish.  Bright Lake should provide a good Northern Pike angling opportunity.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
YELLOW PERCH <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch have historically occurred in relatively low abundance in Bright Lake as catch rates have ranged from 0.0 per trap net in 1999 and 2003 to 1.6 per trap net in 1994.  In 2015, the Yellow Perch catch rate was 0.9 per trap net, which is slightly above the long term average of 0.7 per trap net and within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes.  Size of Yellow Perch was small, with lengths ranging from 5.6 to 8.8 inches and averaging 6.9 inches.  Yellow Perch were plump indicating that forage is readily available.  Trap nets typically do not sample Yellow Perch well this time of year, so Yellow Perch may be more abundant that what the sample suggests.  Gill nets are typically used to sample Yellow Perch, but were not used because of the shallowness of Bright Lake.   <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
WHITE CRAPPIE <br> 
 <br> 
White Crappie were captured at a rate of 61.7 per trap net in 2015, which is the highest recorded catch rate in Bright Lake.  Prior to 2015, catch rates varied from 0.8 per trap net in 1989 to 47.8 per trap net in 2007.  The 2015 catch rate of 61.7 per trap net greatly exceeds the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes.  Many of the White Crappies in Bright Lake are small; however, some fish over 10.0 inches are present (12 percent of the sample).  White Crappie ranged in length from 6.0 to 12.2 inches and averaged 8.0 inches.  White Crappie were plump, suggesting that the population is not stunted and that there is plenty of forage available.  The small size structure is likely a result of the population being comprised of young individuals and harvest of larger White Crappie. Size of Bright Lake's White Crappie should increase after a couple of year's growth.  Bright Lake currently provides a unique angling opportunity for White Crappie.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
BLACK BULLHEAD <br> 
 <br> 
Historic catch rates of Black Bullhead have been highly variable, ranging from 2.2 per trap net in 1989 to 283.5 per trap net in 2003.  In the two surveys since 2003, Black Bullhead abundance has been below the long term average of 122.0 per trap net, being captured at rates of 31.3 per trap net in 2007 and 77.0 per trap net in 2015.  Black Bullhead sampled in 2015 ranged in length from 5.3 to 15.2 inches and averaged 8.9 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
CHANNEL CATFISH <br> 
 <br> 
Channel Catfish were captured at a rate of 1.2 per trap net which exceeds the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes, and is the highest recorded catch rate for Channel Catfish on Bright Lake.  Prior to 2015, catch rates varied from 0.0 per trap net in 1989 to 1.0 per trap net in 1994 and averaged 0.6 per trap net.  Lengths of Channel Catfish ranged from 10.5 to 21.8 inches and averaged 12.8 inches.  If Channel Catfish continue to increase in abundance, it is likely that they may help control the Black Bullhead population and provide an additional angling opportunity.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
OTHER SPECIES <br> 
 <br> 
The Bigmouth Buffalo catch rate was 3.6 per trap net. Lengths ranged from 9.8 to 29.6 inches and averaged 19.8 inches.  Three Black Crappie were sampled and have historically occurred in low numbers (less than 4.5 per trap net) in Bright Lake.  Common Carp abundance in 2015 (3.5 per trap net) remained consistent with 2013's catch rate of 3.7 per trap net.  Common Carp ranged in length from 5.9 to 30.8 inches and averaged 15.1 inches.  Five Quillback were sampled, marking the first time that they have been sampled in Bright Lake.  Other species sampled included Orangespotted Sunfish (N=1), White Sucker (N=8), and Yellow Bullhead (N=9).  <br> 
 <br> 
Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> 
 <br> 
Best management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality.  Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2009-08-17',  County Name = 'Martin', Lake Name = 'Budd' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/17/2009 Clarity: 2.8' 
 Narrative = '<p>Budd is a 222-acre lake with a maximum of 23 feet deep, located within the city limits of Fairmont in Martin County.  Budd Lake is just one of the five lakes in Fairmont that make up what is known as the "Fairmont Chain of Lakes".  Budd is managed primarily for walleye while yellow perch, crappie, and channel catfish are managed secondarily.   <br> 
 <br> 
Based on the 2009 fish survey on Budd Lake, walleye numbers are typical of what we would see in lakes similar to Budd in water chemistry, depth, and size.  Lengths of walleye caught in our gill nets in 2009 ranged from 10.1 to 25.6 inches and averaged 17.2 inches.  Ages of walleye caught in our nets ranged from age 1 to age 15.  There is a good number of walleye in the 10  12 inch range coming up in the fishery.  These fish were more than likely the result of a walleye fingerling stocking in 2008.  The Fairmont Chain of lakes, including Budd, are scheduled to get additional walleye fingerlings in the fall of 2010.   <br> 
 <br> 
Crappie numbers are also typical of lakes similar to Budd.  Both black and white crappie are available to anglers in Budd Lake as well as the entire "Chain" of lakes.  Black crappie have 7-8  dorsal spines with dark splotches against a white background on their body.  White crappie have 5-6 dorsal spines and black splotches that form vertical lines on their bodies.  Lengths of black crappie caught in trap nets ranged from 6.3 to 10.3 inches and averaged 9.0 inches.  Lengths of white crappie caught in trap nets ranged from 8.3 to 9.9 inches and averaged 9.2 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Results from the 2009 fish survey indicated Budd Lake has high numbers of yellow perch available to anglers.  The gill net catch rate of 39.5 fish/net was the highest recorded in the history of netting on the lake.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in our gill nets ranged from 6.3 to 10.8 inches and averaged 7.6 inches.   <br> 
 <br> 
The Fairmont Chain of lakes was stocked once with channel catfish since the reclamation in 1967 when 31 adult catfish were stocked in Hall Lake in 1992.  We first started seeing channel catfish in fish surveys on Budd Lake in 1997 when one fish with a weight of 0.9 lbs was sampled in our nets.  The channel catfish gill net catch rate in 2009 was 6.2 fish/net compared to 4.0 in 2001 and 0.2 in 1997.  Lengths of channel catfish caught in gill nets in 2009 ranged from 12.5 to 26.2 inches and averaged 17.0 inches.   <br> 
 <br> 
Other fish caught in our nets during the assessment in 2009 included bluegill, common carp, northern pike, and white sucker. <br> 
 <br> 
To maintain a healthy fishery in Budd Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMPs) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br>

 Survey Date = '2015-07-06',  County Name = 'Martin', Lake Name = 'Fish' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/06/2015 Clarity: .6' 
 Narrative = '<p>INTRODUCTION  <br> 
 <br> 
Fish Lake is a 175-acre lake located 2 miles southwest of the Town of Odin in Martin County.  Fish Lake is shallow, having a maximum depth of 5.0 feet.  Fish Lake has a history of low dissolved oxygen levels during the winter and therefore is aerated by the Watonwan Game and Fish Club with an Aire-O2 aeration system.  Fish Lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike and secondarily for Walleye, Yellow Perch and Black Crappie.  Northern Pike fingerlings are stocked one out of three years at a rate of 10 per littoral acre (2011, 2014, 2017).  Walleye fingerlings are stocked one out of three years at a rate of one pound per littoral acre (2011, 2014, 2017).  Yellow Perch and Black Crappie have not been stocked in recent history because they have maintained their populations through natural reproduction.  A standard survey was conducted the week of July 6, 2015 to monitor fish populations using two gill nets and eight trap nets.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
NORTHERN PIKE <br> 
 <br> 
In 2015, Northern Pike were captured at a rate of 1.0 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (0.0 to 2.0 per gill net), and at a rate of 2.5 per trap net, which is above the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (0.1 to 0.9 per trap net).  The gill net and trap net catch rates were the highest observed Northern Pike catch rates at Fish Lake.  Northern Pike were 16.1 to 32.4 inches long and averaged 25.5 inches.  Although Northern Pike were not aged, nearly every inch group between 18.0 and 32.0 was present suggesting that the fingerling stockings have been successful or some degree of natural reproduction occurs in this system.  With an average length of 25.5 inches, Fish Lake should provide a good angling opportunity for Northern Pike.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
WALLEYE <br> 
 <br> 
The 2015 Walleye catch rate of 5.0 per gill net decreased slightly from the 2009 catch rate of 7.0 per gill net, but was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (2.3 to 13.3 per gill net).  Walleye were 10.8 to 25.8 inches long and averaged 12.8 inches.  Ninety-five percent of the Walleye sampled were 10.0 to 13.5 inches, and were age-2 (2013 year class). The age-2 Walleyes averaged 12.0 inches, which means they are growing slow.  An additional summer to grow should get these Walleyes to a length that is acceptable to anglers to harvest.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
YELLOW PERCH <br> 
 <br> 
The catch rate of Yellow Perch in 2015 remained below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (3.3 to 30.4 per gill net) at 1.0 per gill net.  The two gill netted Yellow Perch were 5.8 and 6.0 inches in length.  Not much of a Yellow Perch fishery exists in Fish Lake at this time.   <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
BLACK CRAPPIE <br> 
 <br> 
In the past 15 years, catch rates of Black Crappie have decreased from 36.1 per trap net in 2000 to 14.2 per trap net in 2009 to 9.0 per trap net in 2015, but is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (0.7 to 15.3 per trap net).  White Crappie were first sampled in Fish Lake in 2000, being captured at rates of 3.0, 13.0, and 3.0 per trap net in 2000, 2009, and 2015, respectively.  The Black Crappie population may be adjusting to White Crappies being present as well.  The two species can coexist, but competition for food and habitat may cause one of the species to occur at lower abundance than the other.  Black Crappie were 3.8 to 16.7 inches long and averaged 7.3 inches.  The majority of Black Crappie were less than 9.0 inches (94 percent); however, two of the Black Crappie sampled were approaching 17 inches in length. White Crappie were 6.5 to 11.3 inches long and averaged 8.1 inches.  Fish Lake presents a unique opportunity to catch a trophy sized Black Crappie.   <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
CHANNEL CATFISH <br> 
 <br> 
Channel Catfish were sampled for the first time in Fish Lake at a rate of 17.5 per gill net, which is well above the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (0.0 to 3.0 per gill net).  Channel Catfish were 6.9 to 20.3 inches and averaged 10.7 inches.  Channel Catfish likely got into Fish Lake from Cedar Lake which is connected and has historically had a stable Channel Catfish population.  Channel Catfish will provide an additional angling opportunity on Fish Lake.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
BLACK BULLHEAD  <br> 
 <br> 
Black Bullhead catch rates remained low in Fish Lake, as they were captured at a rate of 0.6 per trap net, which is below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (11.5 to 132.6 per trap net).  Historically, Black Bullhead catch rates have ranged from 0.2 per trap net in 2009 to 576.5 per trap net in 1995.  Black Bullhead were 6.3 to 10.2 inches long and averaged 8.2 inches.  Lack of Black Bullhead may be attributed to the Channel Catfish that have recently become established in Fish Lake, because they are a main prey item for Channel Catfish.   <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
OTHER SPECIES <br> 
 <br> 
Abundance of Common Carp has decreased from 25.0 per gill net in 2000 to 10.5 per gill net in 2009 to 4.0 per gill net in 2015.  Common Carp were 21.0 to 26.7 inches long and averaged 23.3 inches.   <br> 
 <br> 
Bigmouth Buffalo were captured at a rate of 1.5 per gill net, which is low compared to similar lakes. They ranged in length from 16.4 to 24.0 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
Freshwater Drum were first sampled in Fish Lake in 2009 at a rate of 14.0 per gill net.  The catch rate in 2015 was similar as they were sampled at a rate of 12.0 per gill net, which is still higher than the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (0.5 to 8.3 per gill net).  Freshwater Drum were 6.3 to 10.2 inches long and averaged 8.2 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> 
 <br> 
Best management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality.  Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2009-08-17',  County Name = 'Martin', Lake Name = 'George' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/18/2009 Clarity: 1.2' 
 Narrative = '<p>George is an 84-acre lake located within the city limits of Fairmont in Martin County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 11 feet and is a class 40 lake.  George Lake is just one of the five lakes in Fairmont that make up what is known as the "Fairmont Chain of Lakes".  George is managed primarily for walleye while yellow perch, largemouth bass, crappie, and bluegill are managed secondarily.  Low dissolved oxygen readings were recorded on George Lake during the winter of 2008-09.  Oxygen levels dropped from 9.1 ppm in early January to 0.4 ppm in early February.  George is connected to Sisseton Lake and fish can migrate into George so determining the extent of any winterkill is almost impossible. <br> 
 <br> 
Based on the 2009 fish survey on George Lake, walleye numbers are typical of what we would see in lakes similar to Budd in water chemistry, depth, and size.  Lengths of walleye caught in our gill nets in 2009 ranged from 10.4 to 22.5 inches and averaged 13.3 inches.  The majority of walleye sampled in our gill nets were one year old.  There is a good number of walleye in the 10 - 12 inch range coming up in the fishery.  These fish were more than likely the result of a walleye fingerling stocking in 2008.  The Fairmont Chain of lakes, including George, are on the list to get additional walleye fingerlings in the fall of 2010.   <br> 
 <br> 
Despite the possible winterkill on George, the bluegill population is doing fairly well.  Lengths of bluegill caught in trap nets in 2009 ranged from 4.1 to 9.2 inches and averaged 7.9 inches.  Since bluegill are susceptible to low oxygen, it is likely that many of these fish migrated into George after oxygen levels recovered in the spring <br> 
 <br> 
Crappie numbers are also typical of lakes similar to George.  Both black and white crappie are available to anglers in George Lake as well as the entire "Chain" of lakes.  Black crappie have 7-8  dorsal spines with dark splotches against a white background on their body.  White crappie have 5-6 dorsal spines and black splotches that form vertical lines on their bodies.  Lengths of black crappie caught in trap nets ranged from 5.8 to 10.3 inches and averaged 9.0 inches.  Lengths of white crappie caught in trap nets ranged from 7.0 to 11.3 inches and averaged 9.4 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Results from the 2009 fish survey indicated George Lake has good numbers of yellow perch available to anglers.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in our gill nets ranged from 6.2 to 9.8 inches and averaged 7.1 inches.   <br> 
 <br> 
The Fairmont Chain of lakes was stocked once with channel catfish since the reclamation in 1967 when 31 adult catfish were stocked in Hall Lake in 1992.  We first started seeing channel catfish in fish surveys on George Lake in 1993 when one fish with a weight of 3.2 lbs was sampled in our nets.  This fish may have been one of the adults stocked in Hall in 1992.  The channel catfish gill net catch rate increased from 1.0 fish/net in 2001 to 7.5 fish/net in 2009.  Lengths of channel catfish caught in gill nets in 2009 ranged from 14.0 to 22.6 inches and averaged 16.5 inches.   <br> 
 <br> 
Other fish caught in our nets during the assessment in 2009 included black bullhead, yellow bullhead, common carp, northern pike, golden shiner, white sucker and 1 red pacu (released from an aquarium). <br> 
 <br> 
To maintain a healthy fishery in George Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP's) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2015-07-13',  County Name = 'Martin', Lake Name = 'Imogene' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/15/2015 Clarity: 1' 
 Narrative = '<p>INTRODUCTION <br> 
 <br> 
Imogene Lake is a 185-acre lake located four miles east of the City of Fairmont in Martin County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 6.0 feet and is characterized by turbid water with frequent algae blooms. Imogene Lake occasionally experiences low dissolved oxygen levels that result in winterkill; therefore, it is managed primarily for Northern Pike and Yellow Perch and secondarily for Walleye.  Recently, Northern Pike fingerlings were stocked in 2010, and Northern Pike adults were stocked in 2014.  Walleye fingerlings were stocked in 2011 and 2014.  Yellow Perch have not been stocked in recent history because they have maintained their population through natural reproduction.  A standard survey was conducted the week of July 13, 2015 to monitor fish populations using two gill nets and eight trap nets. <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
NORTHERN PIKE  <br> 
 <br> 
In 2015, Northern Pike were captured at a rate of 7.5 per gill net, which greatly exceeds the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (0.0 to 2.0 per gill net) and is the highest observed Northern Pike catch rate in Imogene Lake.  Northern Pike were 18.0 to 24.9 inches long and averaged 20.1 inches.  Northern Pike were plump, suggesting that there is plenty of food in the lake.  With another summer of growth complete, Northern Pike should be getting to a size that anglers will harvest.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
YELLOW PERCH <br> 
 <br> 
Since the first survey was conducted, Yellow Perch catch rates have increased from 0.0 per gill net in 2003 to 4.0 per gill net in 2009 to 17.0 per gill net in 2015, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (3.3 to 30.4 per gill net). Lengths of Yellow Perch ranged from 7.6 to 10.7 inches and averaged 9.5 inches.  With an average length of 9.5 inches and Yellow Perch over 10.0 inches present, Imogene Lake could be a good destination for anglers pursuing Yellow Perch.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
WALLEYE <br> 
 <br> 
In the last decade, Imogene Lake has been stocked extensively with Walleye fingerlings and yearlings (2006, 2009, 2011, and 2014).  Despite these efforts, only one, 8.6 inch Walleye was captured during the survey, suggesting that the 2014 fingerling stocking was unsuccessful.  Catch rates of Walleye in Imogene Lake have historically been low as the highest catch rate was 1.5 per gill net in 2009.  Despite the low netting catch rate, local fishing reports indicate "great" fishing for walleye, primarily from Fairmont residents, and could be considered a gem in the rough.   <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
BLACK BULLHEAD <br> 
 <br> 
Catch rates of Black Bullhead in gill nets (30.0 per gill net) and trap nets (7.3 per trap net) were both below their expected ranges of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (30.3 to 150.6 per gill net, 11.5 to 132.6 per trap net).  Since the initial survey done in 2003, catch rates of Black Bullhead in gill nets has declined drastically.  Black Bullhead were 4.4 to 11.1 inches long and averaged 8.1 inches.  The decline in abundance of Black Bullhead could be a result of regular stocking of predators (Northern Pike and Walleye) in Imogene Lake beginning in the mid-2000s.   <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
COMMON CARP <br> 
 <br> 
Common Carp abundance in both gill nets (15.5 per gill net) and trap nets (36.1 per trap net) exceeded their expected ranges of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (1.0 to 13.8 per gill net, 1.0 to 5.5 per trap net).  The trap net catch rate of 36.1 per trap net was the highest recorded for this lake.  Common Carp were 3.7 to 24.0 inches and averaged 6.5 inches, with the majority (96 percent) of them being less than 10.0 inches long.    <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
OTHER SPECIES <br> 
 <br> 
One 25.6 inch Bigmouth Buffalo was sampled.  Green Sunfish, Orangespotted Sunfish, Tadpole Madtom, and Yellow Bullhead were all sampled for the first time in Imogene Lake. Two Freshwater Drum were sampled in 2009, but none were sampled in 2015.  <br> 
 <br> 
Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2014-06-16',  County Name = 'Martin', Lake Name = 'Perch' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/17/2014 Clarity: 2.1' 
 Narrative = '<p>INTRODUCTION <br> 
Perch Lake is a 175-acre, class 43 lake located in Martin County approximately 2.5 miles to the southwest of the City of Truman. Perch Lake is a shallow lake with a maximum depth of 5.0 feet. Perch Lake has a small drainage area as indicated by a watershed size to lake size ratio of 9:1. Despite the small drainage area, agricultural runoff still affects the water quality of Perch Lake which typically has highly turbid water.  Perch Lake is prone to low oxygen levels during the winter months resulting in frequent winterkills. Its susceptibility to winterkill is likely a result of its shallowness and topography surrounding the lake. Perch Lake is situated in a small depression that is surrounded by trees, which prevents snow from blowing off of the lake. Because of its susceptibility to winterkill, Perch Lake is managed for species that are more tolerant of low dissolved oxygen levels such as northern pike (primary management species) and yellow perch (secondary management species). In addition, it is also managed secondarily for black crappie, despite their susceptibility to winterkill, because of its history of producing occasional large crappies. Populations of game fish have been self-sustaining; however, northern pike fingerlings (2005, 2010), fry (2003, 2014), and adults (2014) have been stocked sporadically to supplement the existing population. A population assessment was conducted during the week of June 16, 2014 to monitor fish populations using nine trap nets.  <br> 
 <br> 
NORTHERN PIKE <br> 
Historical catch rates of northern pike in Perch Lake have ranged from 0.5 per trap net in 2002 to 5.7 per trap net in 1997. In 2014, northern pike were captured at a rate of 1.8 per trap net, an increase from 0.7 per trap net observed in the last survey done in 2008. Northern pike ranged in length from 18.1 to 31.5 inches and averaged 24.3 inches. Various northern pike stocking strategies have been tried in Perch Lake, but success has been limited. Fingerlings were stocked in 2005 and 2010; however, the stockings were not evaluated. Most recently in the spring of 2014, northern pike fry were stocked in the wetland directly south of Perch Lake that is periodically connected to the lake, with the idea that the northern pike fry could grow in the mostly vacant wetland (no other fish) and then move to the lake when conditions were favorable. It appears that this stocking was unsuccessful, as a nearshore survey conducted on July 22, 2014 did not capture any young-of-the-year (YOY) northern pike. In response, 200 adult northern pike were stocked in November 2014.  <br> 
 <br> 
YELLOW PERCH <br> 
Yellow perch were captured at a rate of 0.4 per trap net, similar to the catch rate observed in 2008 (0.7 per trap net). The 2014 yellow perch catch rate was within the expected range of catch rates for lakes similar to Perch Lake (0.3 to 3.8 per trap net). Gill nets typically sample yellow perch populations more effectively than trap nets, but gill nets were not used because of the shallowness of Perch Lake. Yellow perch ranged in length from 4.7 to 9.5 inches and averaged 6.1 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
BLACK CRAPPIE <br> 
The black crappie population in Perch Lake is highly variable as catch rates have ranged from 0.0 per trap net in 2014 to 24.0 per trap net in 2008. The 2014 catch rate of 0.0 per trap net is the lowest observed catch rate for Perch Lake, down from the all-time high catch rate observed in 2008 and lower than the expected range of catch rates (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net) for lakes similar to Perch Lake. The lack of crappies sampled indicates that a winterkill likely occurred since the 2008 survey. It is characteristic of crappie populations to be boom or bust, with the population often being comprised mostly of one strong year class.  <br> 
 <br> 
OTHER SPECIES <br> 
The bullhead catch rate was the highest ever observed for Perch Lake at 113.4 per trap net, but was within the expected range of catch rates lakes similar to Perch Lake (11.5 to 132.6 per trap net). Prior to the 2014 survey, catch rates ranged from 22.1 per trap net in 1997 to 71.5 per trap net in 2002. This indicates that Perch Lake may have experienced a winterkill since the 2008 survey, as black bullheads tend to proliferate following winterkill. Black bullheads ranged from 4.3 to 11.9 inches, and averaged 8.3 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
The common carp catch rate declined since the last survey from 6.7 per trap net in 2008 to 0.6 per trap net in 2014. Historically, catch rates have varied from 0.1 per trap net in 2002 to 6.7 per trap net in 2008. The 2014 catch rate was below the expected range of catch rates lakes similar to Perch Lake (1.0 to 5.5 per trap net).  <br> 
 <br> 
Other species sampled included white sucker (n=1), and yellow bullhead (n=2), both species that have been sampled in previous surveys.  <br> 
 <br> 
Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> 
 <br> 
Best management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake. High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality. Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br>

 Narrative = '<p>INTRODUCTION <br> 
Temperance Lake is a 176-acre lake located just east of the City of Sherburn in Martin County.  Temperance Lake is shallow, having a maximum depth of 5 ft. Due to its shallowness, the lake is prone to low oxygen levels in the winter. The last recorded low oxygen event occurred during the winter of 2008-2009; however, it was determined that the low oxygen had minimal effects on the fish population. Although Temperance Lake is located near the top of the watershed, the water quality during the survey was poor as the secchi depth was 0.5 ft. The poor water quality is likely a result of nutrient runoff from nearby agricultural fields. The practically unlimited nutrient supply provides an environment in which microscopic organisms such as algae can thrive, resulting in extreme algae blooms. The lake bottom sediments could also be disturbed by wind action due to the lakes shallowness or by benthic omnivores such as common carp, both contributing to the poor water quality. Temperance Lake is managed primarily for northern pike and secondarily for yellow perch. Northern pike are stocked at a rate of 20 fingerlings per acre once every three years and have been stocked in 2005, 2008, and 2011 and are due to be stocked in 2014 if available. A population assessment was conducted during the week of August 23, 2013 to monitor fish populations using one gill net and nine trap nets. <br> 
 <br> 
NORTHERN PIKE <br> 
Catch rates of northern pike have varied greatly in Temperance Lake, ranging from 0.5 per gill net in 1996 to 48.5 per gill net in 1991 and from 0.7 per trap net in 1996 to 17.6 per trap net in 1991. Record high catch rates were observed in 1991, the result of a very successful naturally reproduced year class. The 2013 trap net catch rate was up from the previous survey in 2007, increasing from 1.3 per trap net in 2007 to 5.2 per trap net in 2013. Size structure of trap netted northern pike was small, as they ranged in length from 18.5 to 25.4 inches and averaged 22.9 inches. Northern pike were skinny. It does not appear that prey is limited in this system, as yellow perch were captured at a rate of 29.0 per gill net, which is above the expected catch rate for similar lakes. The below average weights of northern pike may be related to increased stress levels during the growing season, caused by warm water temperatures during the summer, as northern pike are a cool water species that can be sensitive to increased water temperatures. The northern pike in Temperance Lake are likely fish that were stocked; however, natural reproduction has been documented in previous years, making it a possibility that they were naturally spawned in the lake. The availability of northern pike spawning habitat is often influenced by the amount of precipitation. Successful spawning is likely limited to years with above average precipitation when water levels are high enough to inundate vegetation. The current stocking regime appears to be effective at providing a fishable northern pike population and should be continued. Northern pike could be an easy target for anglers because of the small size of the lake.  <br> 
 <br> 
YELLOW PERCH  <br> 
Gill net catch rates of yellow perch in Temperance Lake have been highly variable, ranging from 29.0 per gill net in 2013 to 161.0 per gill net in 1991 and averaging 80.0 per gill net since 1991. In 2013, the catch rate of yellow perch was 29.0 per gill net, which is the lowest observed gill net catch rate for Temperance Lake; however, the catch rate exceeded the expected catch rate range (2.7 per gill net to 25.0 per gill net) for similar lakes indicating that the yellow perch population is doing well. The 2013 trap net catch rate also exceeded the expected catch range (0.3 to 3.8 per trap net) for similar lakes, which is also indicative of an abundant population given that trap nets typically do not sample yellow perch well in the August heat. Yellow perch were small ranging in length from 4.8 to 8.9 inches and averaging 6.1 inches. Although the small size structure of yellow perch is not desirable for angling, it does provide a great forage base for the northern pike population. <br> 
 <br> 
OTHER SPECIES <br> 
Common carp were captured at a rate of 27.0 per gill net in 2013, which is high when compared to similar lakes and is the highest catch rate observed for Temperance Lake. The trap net catch rate of common carp was 2.3 per trap net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.0 to 5.5 per trap net). Common carp ranged in length from 12.2 to 28.2 inches and averaged 16.8 inches. The poor water quality in Temperance Lake is likely somewhat attributable to the abundant common carp population, as carp tend to uproot vegetation and stir up sediments when feeding. The common carp population will likely be abundant until a severe winterkill event occurs.   <br> 
 <br> 
Black bullheads were captured at a rate of 30.0 per gill net which is below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (30.3 to 150.6 per gill net). Black bullheads have never been a problem in Temperance Lake, as the highest catch rate recorded was 46.0 per gill net in 1991. Gill netted black bullheads ranged in length from 6.9 to 10.9 inches and averaged 8.5 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Since the initial survey in 1991, bigmouth buffalo gill net catch rates have exceeded the expected range of catch rates (0.8 to 7.0 per gill net) for similar lakes. The 2013 catch rate followed this trend as bigmouth buffalo were captured at a rate of 9.0 per gill net. The bigmouth buffalo ranged in length from 4.1 to 28.4 inches and averaged 18.5 inches. It appears bigmouth buffalo had a successful spawning season, as young-of-the-year (YOY) buffalo were sampled in the survey.   <br> 
 <br> 
Other species sampled included white sucker, yellow bullhead, and black crappie. In addition to these species, a near shore survey conducted after the population assessment sampled fathead minnows, and orangespotted sunfish. Young-of-the-year black bullheads, orangespotted sunfish, and yellow perch were extremely abundant, indicating that ample forage exists in Temperance Lake.  <br> 
 <br> 
Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> 
 <br> 
Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> 
 <br> 
Best management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake. High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality. Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery <br>

 Survey Date = '2012-06-25',  County Name = 'McLeod', Lake Name = 'Otter' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/25/2012 Clarity: 1.4' 
 Narrative = '<p>A full resurvey was conducted at Otter/Campbell Reservoir in 2012 to monitor the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the system.  A total of 15 species were sampled in the gill nets and trap nets.   The old dam, at the outlet, was replaced with a rock step type structure around 2009.  This new structure may be responsible for the increases in relative abundance of channel catfish, northern pike, and walleye.  In 2012, shorthead redhorse were sampled for the first time at Otter/Campbell Reservoir.    <br> 
 <br> 
The Otter/Campbell lakeshed (285,237 acres) was highly disturbed and dominated (83%) by row crop agriculture.  The shoreline was heavily developed, with residential homes (189) making up the largest type of shoreline use (72%) in 2012.  The lakeshed to lake ratio was 445:1.  Aquatic vegetation was rated as rare.  Only 2 varieties of submergent vegetation, Curlyleaf pondweed and sago pondweed, were sampled in 2012.  The reservoir continued to be plagued by intense algal blooms and poor water quality.  The secchi disk reading was only 1.4 feet on 6/25/12.  The only shoalwater substrate that was classified as abundant was silt.   <br> 
 <br> 
Gill nets sampled moderate numbers (53) of northern pike for a catch rate of 5.9/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  This was the second highest catch rate ever recorded at the reservoir.  The 2005 catch rate was 0.8/net.  Catch rates from 1975 to 2012 were variable, ranging from 0.8 to 9.1/net with an average of 3.8 and median (middle most data point) of 1.7.  Historically speaking, recruitment could be classified as low.  Gill netted northern pike were 14.2 to 31.8 inches long with an average of 21.9.  Approximately 26% fo the gill net catch was 24 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure.   Northern pike were last stocked in 1992.  Northern pike were age-1 through age-7 with 7 year-classes present.  Age-2 and age-3 fish were the strongest year-classes, accounting for 26% and 35% of the gill net catch, respectively.  Growth was somewhat slow.  A summerkill of northern pike occurred in July 2012, when the water temperature climbed into the upper 80 degrees F range.         <br> 
 <br> 
Trap nets sampled low numbers (35) of black crappie for a catch rate of 3.9/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2005 catch rate was (8.7/net).  Catch rates from 1975 to 2012 ranged from 0.7 to 14.0/net with an average of 6.1.  Trap netted black crappie were 4.3 to 8.8 inches long with an average of 7.5.  Gill nets sampled moderate numbers (88) of black crappie for a catch rate of 9.8/net, which was within the lake's normal range.  The 2005 gill net catch rate was 1.7/net.  Historic catch rates were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 9.8/net with an average of 2.8.  Gill netted black crappie were 4.4 to 11.2 inches long with an average of 7.5.  Black crappie were age-1 to age-5 with 5 year-classes present.  Age-2 fish made up 54% of the gill net catch and 91% of the trap net catch.  Growth was moderate.  Black crappie were last stocked in 1992. <br> 
 <br> 
Trap nets sampled low numbers (7) of white crappie for a catch rate of 0.8/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2005 catch rate was 1.8/net.  Historic catch rates from 1975 to 2012 ranged from 0.0 to 14.0/net with an averae of 3.9.  Trap netted white crappie were 7.9 to 13.0 inches long with an average of 10.5.  Gill nets also sampled low numbers (18) of white crappie for a catch rate of 2.0/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Historic catch rates ranged from 0.0 to 10.9/net with an average of 4.9.  Gill netted fish were 4.9 to 13.5 inches long with an average of 8.1.  White crappie were age-1 to age-4 with 4 year-classes present.  Growth was fast.  An easy way to tell the difference between white crappie and black crappie is to count the number of dorsal spines.  White crappie have 5 or 6 spines while black crappie have 7 or 8 spines.  <br> 
  <br> 
Gill nets sampled high numbers (129) of walleye for a catch rate of 14.3/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake and the highest ever recorded.  The 2005 catch rate was 6.0/net.  Catch rates from 1975 to 2012 were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 14.3/net with an average of 6.0.  Gill netted walleye were 7.5 to 22.6 inches long with an average of 16.1.  Approximatley 87% of the gill net sample was 13 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure.  Walleye were age-1 to age-6 with 6 year-classes present.  The 2009 and 2010 year-classes were both ranked as strong, accounting for 56% and 24% of the catch, respectively.  Walleye were last stocked in 1990.  In 2012, growth was fast.  Anecdotal reports indicated that there was a significant amount of fishing pressure during the summer, fall, and winter of 2012, on the reservoir, with fair to good success for walleye.  <br> 
  <br> 
Gill nets sampled high numbers (67) of channel catfish for a catch rate of 7.4/net.  The 2012 catch rate was over 24 times greater than the previous high catch rate (0.3/net in 2005).  Historic catch rates ranged from 0.0 to 7.4/net with an average of 1.6.  In 2012, channel catfish were 6.7 to 27.2 inches long with an averge of 14.3.  Channel catfish were age-1 to age-10 with 8 year-classes present.  The 2010 year-class accounted for 50% of the gill netted fish that were aged.  Standard shoreline seining sampled 6 young-of-the-year channel catfish, which likely indicated that fish were spawning successfully within the reservoir. <br> 
 <br> 
Trap nets sampled low numbers (6) of bluegill for a catch rate of 0.7/net which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2005 catch rate was also low (3.2/net).  Historic catch rates from 1975 to 2012 were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 9.7/net, with an average of 2.3.  In 2012, trap netted bluegill were 6.1 to 7.6 inches long with an average of 6.6.  Bluegill were age-3 to age-5 with 3 year-classes present.  Growth was moderate to fast.  Young-of-the-year bluegill (2,327) were the most abundantly sampled fish from the shoreline seining portion of the assessment.  Winterkill and a lack of submergent vegetation were likely major limiting factors on this species.  <br> 
    <br> 
Gill nets sampled low numbers (6) of largemouth bass for a catch rate of 0.7/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Gill netted largemouth bass were 6.9 to 14.2 inches long.  Trap nets sampled 2 largemouth bass, up to 15.2 inches in length.  Largemouth bass were age-1 to age-4 with 4 year-classes present.  Growth was fast.  Winterkill and a lack of submergent vegetation were likely major limiting factors on this species.    <br> 
  <br> 
Gill nets sampled low numbers (12) of yellow perch for a catch rate of 1.3/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 catch rate was similar at 4.9/net.  Catch rates from 1975 to 2012 were mostly low, ranging from 0.8 to 18.7/net with an average of 5.4.  Yellow perch were 5.5 to 9.7 inches long with an average of 8.1. <br> 
 <br> 
Trap nets sampled high numbers (36) of carp for a catch rate of 4.0/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  Historic catch rates from 1975 to 2012 were mostly high, ranging from 0.5 to 47.3/net with an average of 16.7.  Trap netted carp were 14.3 to 32.1 inches long with an average of 20.1.  Gill nets also sampled high numbers (67) of carp for a catch rate of 7.4/net, which was above the lake's normal range.  Historic catch rates were all high, ranging from 7.2 to 34.9/net with an average of 13.6.  Gill netted carp were 8.3 to 27.4 inches long with an average of 18.7.  High numbers of carp, over the last 35+ years, have likely had significant negative impacts on submergent plant abundance and water quality in Otter/Campbell Reservoir.  <br> 
 <br> 
Gill nets sampled high numbers (603) of black bullhead for a catch rate of 67.0/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2012 catch rate was the second highest on record, going back to the 1975 assessment.  Historic catch rates from 1975 to 2012 were mostly moderate to high, ranging from 28.7 to 96.3/net with an average of 55.1.  Gill netted black bullhead were 4.7 to 18.3 inches long with an average of7.5.  Trap nets sampled low numbers (59) of black bullhead for a catch rate of 6.6/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The majority of the fish were too small to appeal to bullhead anglers.  In recent years, many area lakes have experienced a decline in black bullhead abundance, but not the reservoir.   <br> 
    <br> 
Additional species sampled in the standard gear included; bigmouth buffalo, brown bullhead, white sucker, and yellow bullhead.    <br> 
 <br> 
Otter/Campbell has a long history of winterkill and the reservoir was opened to liberalized fishing as recently as 2009.  Winter dissolved oxygen concentrations were very low in all three sections of the reservoir during the 2012-2013 winter.  Dead fish were reported just above the dam in early March, 2013.  Fish populations can vary greatly from year to year, depending on the frequency and severity of winterkill. </p>'

 Lake Clarity = '' 
 Narrative = '<p>Gill nets, trap nets and shoreline seining were used to sample the Hoff Lake fish population during the 2004 summer.  Aquatic plant sampling and water quality monitoring were also conducted.  Hoff Lake has a history of winterkill with a partial kill occurring during the 2003-2004 winter.  Fish populations can fluctuate greatly depending on the frequency and severity of this phenomenon.  Hoff Lake is highly fertile and shallow.  Aquatic vegetation, mainly curlyleaf pondweed, was abundant until it died back in late June.  Other submergent aquatic plant species would be considered rare in this lake.  Much of the lakeshore is undeveloped and row crops dominate the lake's watershed.  Limited shore fishing is available on the south end of the lake near the public access.  High numbers of northern pike were gill netted in 2004.  Pike were 11.2-31.7 inches long averaging 23.4 inches.  The 2001 year class was particlarly strong.  Moderate numbers of black crappie were trap netted.  Black crappie were 4.2-12.3 inches long averaging 7.8 inches.  Approximately 45% of the sample 8 inches or longer.  Moderate numbers of white crappie were trap netted averaging 8.8 inches.  Low numbers of bluegill, yellow perch and largemouth bass were also sampled.  A few of the bluegill and yellow perch were keeper sized.  Black bullhead dominated the catch, as they have since the lake was first netted back in 1978.  Black bullhead were small, averaging 6.3 inches.  High numbers of carp were gill netted, averaging 15.5 inches.  Hoff Lake was used as a walleye rearing pond in 2004, with hopes of producing fingerlings for statewide stocking efforts.  Carry-over would then be available to anglers.  No walleye fingerlings were harvested that fall, but 2 young-of-the-year walleye were captured during shoreline seining.  Anglers may want to concentrate their efforts on northern pike and crappie when fishing this occassional winterkill lake.</p>'

Aquatic plant sampling and water quality monitoring were also conducted.  Hope Lake has a history of winterkill, and fish population levels can fluctuate greatly depending on the frequency and severity of this phenomenon.  There is no developed public access at Hope Lake.  Hope Lake is shallow and very fertile.  Submergent vegetation would be considered rare in this lake, but quality patches of emergent bullrush and cattail still exist.  The lake's watershed is dominated by row crops and much of the shoreline and island remain undeveloped.  High numbers of yellow perch were gill netted in 2004.  Yellow perch were 5.3-11.3 inches long averaging 8.6 inches.  An impressive 69% of the sample was at least 8 inches and 17% reached the 10 inch mark.  Most of the perch were from the strong 2001 year class.  High numbers of northern pike were also gill netted.  Northern pike were 19.5-30.5 inches long averaging 24.5 inches.  The last time this lake was netted (1991), a handful of small bluegill and small yellow perch were all the gamemfish the lake had to offer anglers.  Hopefully the present population will provide some angling opportunity before the next winterkill occurs.  Black bullhead, which have dominated past nettings, were only sampled in moderate numbers in 2004.  Trap netted black bullhead averaged 4.3 inches.  Moderate numbers of carp were also trapped, averaging 19.8 inches.    </p>'

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2012-08-27',  County Name = 'Morrison', Lake Name = 'Long' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/27/2012 Clarity: 10.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>    Long Lake is a small, 120 acre lake with a maximum depth of 35 feet and good water clarity.  The secchi disk reading of 10.5 feet at the end of August is better than average for a lake in central Minnesota.  The lake has abundant wild rice which forms a thick band around much of the lake.  There is a township owned public access on the east side.  Parking is limited as the access is narrow and the ramp is sand and gravel.  Much of the lake is developed except for the southwest side and north end which are mostly marsh.  Primary management species are largemouth bass and northern pike. <br> 
    The bass population in the lake has remained relatively stable over the years.  The average size in spring night electrofishing was about 12 inches or 1 pound with bass up to 17 inches measured.  Northern pike abundance has increased since the last survey and the population is dominated by smaller fish as few were more than 24 inches in length.   High pike numbers can be detrimental to the entire fish community and especially walleye management.   Anglers should consider keeping northern pike less than 24 inches as a harvestable surplus of small fish exists. <br> 
 A spring assessment in 2012 targeted the panfish in the lake since they provide an important fishery.  These spring nettings tend to exhibit a better picture of the adult bluegill population than the summer surveys do.   Most of the bluegill caught in the spring assessment were between 6.5 and 7.5 inches although a few over 8 inches were measured.  Long Lake appears to have a decent black crappie population as fish exceeding 9 inches were common in the spring sampling efforts.  Three other species of panfish in the lake include green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed.  <br> 
        Despite stocking by the Long Lake Association, the walleye population has shown no improvement in abundance.  For anglers lucky enough to hook into a walleye, chances are that it will be a nice one as two of three fish caught in the survey were over 18 inches.  Yellow perch have also been stocked by both the DNR and lake association in an attempt to increase abundance of the perch which could improve northern pike size and survival of the walleye.  This strategy has not worked either.   <br> 
     Other species found in the lake include yellow bullhead and bowfin or dogfish.  Bowfin can provide quite a fight for an angler and are known to be efficient predators on small bluegills.  Common carp were also observed during the spring electrofishing for largemouth bass. <br> 
     Protecting Long Lake's extensive emergent vegetation beds should be a priority of the lake association and lakeshore owners.  Not only does the vegetation provide valuable habitat for the fish and wildlife, it also removes excess nutrients from the water and protects the shoreline from erosion.  Lakeshore owners are encouraged to keep grass clippings and raked leaves out of the water to reduce nutrients entering the lake.  Poorly maintained septic systems can be a significant source of nutrients to a lake leading to algae blooms and excessive weed growth.  Anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest and return the larger fish of each species to the water to achieve a more balanced fish community.  Harvesting small pike can reduce predation on the yellow perch, bass, and juvenile walleye, improving survival of those species. <br>

 Survey Date = '2012-08-20',  County Name = 'Morrison', Lake Name = 'Peavy' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/20/2012 Clarity: 13.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>     Peavy Lake is a small, clear, relatively deep lake in northeast Morrison County.  The lake has a variety of offshore fishing structures for anglers such as points, sunken islands, and steep dropoffs as well as dense vegetation beds.  Water clarity is excellent with a secchi disk reading of 13.5 feet in late August.  Peavy  is a soft water lake meaning that it has less fertility than many lakes in the area resulting in lower population abundance for some species.  Much of the lakeshore suitable for development has homes present.  Fish management focus is on black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, and northern pike. <br> 
     Panfish probably provide the most important fishery on the lake and anglers have a chance to catch crappie in a variety of sizes.   Crappies between 4.5 and 12 inches were observed in the 2012 nets with the average size about 9 inches.   Bluegill in Peavy Lake average about six inches although some nicer fish up to almost nine inches were caught in both the summer assessment and a spring assessment.  Some nice size pumpkinseed sunfish were also caught in the spring netting.   <br> 
     Anglers looking for northern pike have the potential to catch some desirable sized fish as the average weight in the summer survey was about three pounds and several of the fish caught in 2012 were over thirty inches.   Peavy Lake has a low walleye population that appears to be sustained through natural reproduction as stocking was discontinued in 1988.  Only two walleye were caught in the summer and spring assessments and they were both around 22 inches.  Most of the largemouth bass caught by anglers are likely to be between 10 and 13 inches, however, trophy size bass have been measured in other assessments.   <br> 
     Yellow bullhead was the most abundant of the two bullhead species caught in the 2012 assessments.  Quality size individuals over thirteen inches were observed in both the yellow and brown bullhead catches.  Anglers also have the opportunity to catch a bowfin or dogfish which could provide a good fight.  Dogfish can also be an efficient predator on small bluegills which could help keep the bluegill population in check and reduce chances of stunting.   <br> 
     Maintaining and protecting the water quality in Peavy Lake should be a high priority of the lakeshore land owners.  Buffer strips along the shoreline are encouraged to reduce nutrients entering the water.  Maintaining adequate septic systems, keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out of the lake, and common sense use of lawn fertilizers will also help reduce nutrient loading, thus slowing algae and excess weed growth.   <br>

 Narrative = '<p>East Side Lake is a small (39.0 acre) lake located in the Town of Austin in Mower County. Residential development has disturbed and altered the majority of East Side Lake's shoreline. In areas with residential development, lawns are typically maintained to the shores edge, which limits the functionality of the riparian buffer. East Side Lake is unique in that it is situated in a part of Minnesota that has very few lakes, and because it provides an urban fishery opportunity for the Town of Austin. A city owned public access is located on the east side of the lake in the City Park. East Side Lake provides ample shoreline angling opportunities because the city park encompasses the entire east side of the lake. Natural reproduction is sufficient to maintain crappie, largemouth bass, and bluegill populations; however, walleye fingerlings and adults were stocked in 2007 and 2011 to maintain the walleye population. Primary management species in East Side Lake include bluegill and black crappie, and secondary management species include walleye and largemouth bass. A population assessment was conducted on 8-15-2012 to monitor fish populations in East Side Lake using 1 gill net and 6 trap nets. <br> 
 <br> 
Water quality was poor at East Side Lake during the assessment. The brown/green water was turbid and had a secchi depth of 1.0 feet. The turbid water color was likely caused by algae blooms and runoff events. Dissolved oxygen was good ranging from 21.0 ppm at the surface to 10.5 ppm at 3.0 feet deep.  <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie catch rates have decreased significantly in the last decade. In 2003, 2007, and 2012, black crappies were captured at rates of 119.5, 72.5, and 17.8/trap net, which are high compared to similar lakes. Black crappie size structure was small with lengths ranging from 2.6 to 8.2 inches and averaging 7.3 inches. White crappies were also present but occurred in lower numbers than black crappie (4.3/trap net) which is about average for similar lakes. White crappies were small with all of them being less than 9.5 inches in length. The 2012 white crappie catch rate was the lowest observed catch rate on East Side Lake. <br> 
 <br> 
The 2012 bluegill catch rate (2.3/trap net) decreased since the 2007 survey (29.7/trap net), which is low when compared to similar lakes. The size of bluegills was decent with lengths ranging from 5.2 to 7.1 inches and averaging 6.1 inches. The 2012 bluegill catch rate was the lowest ever observed on East Side Lake. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill and crappie catch rates were the lowest that have been documented on East Side Lake and were likely the result of a summer fish kill reported on July 24, 2012. Locals reported thousands of dead black crappies, largemouth bass, bluegills, and minnows.   <br> 
 <br> 
Walleyes are a secondary management species in East Side Lake and are periodically stocked to maintain the existing population. In 2007, walleyes were captured at a rate of 2.0/gill net and increased to 6.0/gill net in 2012 which was relatively high compared to similar lakes. Otolith ages indicated a successful stocking in 2011, as all of the walleyes collected were age-1. The walleyes exhibited good growth ranging in length from 9.5 to 11.7 inches after their first year.  <br> 
 <br> 
White sucker have historically been abundant in East Side Lake and the trend continued as they were caught at a rate of 23.0/gill net and 9.8/trap net. Common carp, golden shiner, largemouth bass, black bullhead, and green sunfish were present but occurred in low numbers. <br>

 Survey Date = '2015-06-29',  County Name = 'Murray', Lake Name = 'Buffalo' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/29/2015 Clarity: 1' 
 Narrative = '<p>INTRODUCTION <br> 
 <br> 
Buffalo Lake is a 124-acre located near the Town of Dovray in Murray County.  Buffalo Lake has a maximum depth of 8.5 feet, and typically has turbid water (Secchi depth = 1.0 feet).  Buffalo Lake is occasionally susceptible to low dissolved oxygen levels during the winter, with the last documented winterkill occurring during the winter of 2009-2010.  During this winter, dissolved oxygen levels dropped to 0.2 parts per million (ppm) by mid-January so the aeration system was not operated to encourage winterkill of Common Carp and other undesirable fish species.  A winterkill check during the spring of 2010 captured six species of fish; however, Common Carp were not sampled despite seeing high numbers of them (27.5 per gill net) during the survey in the summer of 2009.   Because of its susceptibility to winterkill, Buffalo Lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike and secondarily for Yellow Perch and Crappie because these species are more tolerant of low dissolved oxygen levels than other species such as Walleye. Northern Pike fingerlings have occasionally been stocked (2006 and 2010) to supplement the existing population; however, it is likely that Northern Pike naturally reproduce in this system because it has connected wetlands that provide spawning habitat.  Yellow perch and crappie populations are self-sustaining and have not been stocked in the last decade.  Buffalo Lake was surveyed the week of June 29, 2015 to monitor fish populations using two gill nets and eight trap nets.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
NORTHERN PIKE <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike tend to do well in Buffalo Lake, as gill net catches have varied from 2.5 per gill net in 2009 to 12.0 per gill net in 2003, all of which exceed expected catch rates for similar lakes (0.0 to 2.0 per gill net) in the Windom management area.  In 2015, the Northern Pike catch rate was within the historical range of catch rates (2.5 to 12.0 per gill net), as they were captured at a rate of 5.5 per gill net, the second highest catch rate observed on this lake.  There are at least four year classes of Northern Pike present, suggesting that their population is sustained through natural reproduction.  Additionally, young-of-the-year (YOY) Northern Pike (N=3) were captured in the nearshore survey, indicating that there was natural reproduction in 2015.  Northern Pike are a decent size with lengths ranging from 16.5 to 30.2 inches and averaging 22.7 inches.  Northern Pike were plump suggesting that forage is not limited in this system.  The Northern Pike in Buffalo Lake should provide good opportunity for anglers and winter spearers alike.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
YELLOW PERCH <br> 
 <br> 
In 2015, Yellow Perch were captured at a rate of 19.0 per gill net, which is the second highest catch rate observed in Buffalo Lake.  Historic catch rates have varied from 0.5 per gill net in 2003 to 22.0 per gill net in 1998 and have averaged 12.8 per gill net since 1998.  The 2015 catch rate is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.3 to 30.4 per gill net) in the Windom management area.  The majority of the Yellow Perch were small, ranging in length from 5.3 to 8.5 inches and averaging 6.3 inches.  Eighty-nine percent of the yellow perch sampled were less than 7.5 inches in length.  Yellow Perch were plump indicating that food is available.  The perch population appears to be naturally reproducing in Buffalo Lake, as nearshore sampling captured 475 Age-0 Yellow Perch. <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
CRAPPIE <br> 
 <br> 
Abundance of Black Crappie in Buffalo Lake is trending downward as catch rates have decreased from 46.9 to 13.6 to 1.3 per trap net in 2003, 2009, and 2015, respectively.  The 2015 catch rate of 1.3 per trap net is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the Windom management area (0.7 to 15.3 per trap net), but is well below the long term average of 15.5 per trap net.  Black Crappie abundance tends to be boom-or-bust where a strong year class will account for the majority of the population at a given time.  Three to four year classes of Crappie are present in Buffalo Lake, with lengths ranging from 4.6 to 14.5 inches and averaging 8.9 inches.  It should be noted that when you have a high abundance of another panfish, like yellow perch, it is not surprising to see a low catch.  Zero YOY Black Crappie were sampled in the nearshore survey suggesting that they did not reproduce in Buffalo Lake this year.  Black Crappie were very plump indicating that ample forage is available to them.  Historically, White Crappie have also been present in Buffalo Lake, but none were sampled in 2015.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
BLACK BULLHEAD <br> 
 <br> 
 Catch rates of Black Bullhead in 2015 were near the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in gill nets (131.5 per gill net; expected range 30.3  150.6 per gill net) and in trap nets (121.8 per trap net; expected range 11.5 to 132.6 per trap net).  Historic catch rates of Black Bullhead in gill nets have ranged from 18.5 per gill net in 2009 to 178.0 per gill net in 1998, and have averaged 105.3 per gill net since 1993.  Historic catch rates of Black Bullhead in trap nets have ranged from 1.4 per trap net in 2009 to 347.0 per trap net in 1998, and have averaged 147.6 per trap net since 1993.  Black Bullhead ranged in length from 3.7 to 13.3 inches and averaged 7.4 inches.    <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
OTHER SPECIES <br> 
 <br> 
Two Walleye were captured in the gill net (21.0 and 21.7 inches), despite not being stocked by MNDNR.  It is likely that these fish were illegally transferred by an angler.  To avoid unintended introductions, anglers should be diligent about disposing of unused bait in the trash, and should report unpermitted movement of fish.  <br> 
 <br> 
Consistent with the winterkill check done in 2010, zero Common Carp were captured during this survey.  In the previous survey done in 2009, Common Carp abundance was high (27.5 per gill net). The aeration system was not run, per our guidance to Murray County, during the winter of 2009-2010 when dissolved oxygen levels dropped below 0.2 ppm by mid-January, with the intention of trying to decimate the abundant carp population. It appears this effort was successful.  <br> 
 <br> 
Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> 
 <br> 
Best management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality.  Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2014-07-14',  County Name = 'Murray', Lake Name = 'Corabelle' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/15/2014 Clarity: .7' 
 Narrative = '<p> INTRODUCTION <br> 
Corabelle Lake is a 107-acre lake located 3 miles south of the City of Iona in Murray County. Corabelle Lake is shallow with a maximum depth of 6.0 feet. Corabelle Lake has a watershed-to-lake ratio of 4:1 which indicates that it has a relatively small watershed. Despite the small watershed, Corabelle Lake's water quality is poor as indicated by a secchi depth of 0.7 feet. The poor water quality is likely a result of nutrient runoff from adjacent agricultural fields. The primary management species in Corabelle Lake is northern pike, while yellow perch and black crappie are managed secondarily. The northern pike population is maintained through fingerling stocking one out of four years (2004, 2007, 2010, and 2014). Adult black crappies have also occasionally been stocked after suspected winterkills to maintain the spawning broodstock (2005 and 2012). The yellow perch population has been self-sustaining, with no stocking occurring in the recent past. A population assessment was conducted during the week of July 14, 2014 to monitor fish populations using nine trap nets.  <br> 
 <br> 
NORTHERN PIKE <br> 
Historically, northern pike have occurred in low abundance in Corabelle Lake, with catch rates ranging from 0.6 per net in 2001 to 2.2 per net in 1996. The 2014 catch rate was within this range as northern pike were captured at a rate of 0.7 per trap net, slightly below the long term average of 1.1 per trap net and down from the 2008 catch rate of 1.0 per trap net. Lengths of northern pike ranged from 24.2 to 31.7 inches and averaged 28.0 inches. Northern pike were chunky, weighing an average of almost five pounds.  <br> 
 <br> 
YELLOW PERCH <br> 
The yellow perch catch rate in 2014 (3.7 per trap net) was similar to the catch rate in 2008 (4.4 per trap net) and was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.3 to 3.8 per trap net). The 2014 catch rate of 3.7 per trap net is below the long term average of 7.3 per trap net; however, the long term average was highly influenced by high catch rates in the 1996 and 2001 surveys (10.3 and 10.8 per trap net, respectively). A winterkill assessment was done in April 2011, during which yellow perch were captured at a rate of 105.0 per trap net. The timing of the survey likely resulted in this high catch rate because nets were set when yellow perch were likely moving inshore to find spawning areas. In 2014, yellow perch were small, ranging in length from 4.7 to 6.6 inches and averaging 5.5 inches. In comparison, lengths during the 2011 winterkill assessment ranged from 3.2 to 11.1 inches and averaged 8.0 inches. Yellow perch are typically sampled more effectively with gill nets; however gill nets were not used in 2014 because of the shallowness of the basin. The time of year (mid-July) and the gear used (trap nets) in 2014 may be underestimating perch abundance and size structure in Corabelle Lake.  <br> 
 <br> 
BLACK CRAPPIE <br> 
The black crappie population has been increasing since the 2001 survey, from 0.2 per trap net in 2001 to 2.2 per trap net in 2008 to 3.4 per trap net in 2014. The 2014 catch rate was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net). Black crappies ranged in length from 4.3 to 5.3 inches and averaged 4.9 inches. The narrow range of lengths indicate the presence of one year class, likely age-2 fish, that were a result of the pre-spawn adult black crappies stocked in early May of 2012, following the partial winterkill during the winter of 2010. In a couple of years, crappies should attain a length that is acceptable to anglers.  <br> 
 <br> 
OTHER SPECIES <br> 
The black bullhead catch rate in 2014 (11.7 per trap net) remained unchanged from the 2008 catch rate (11.8 per trap net), and was significantly less than catch rates observed in 2001 and 1996 (44.9 and 52.8 per trap net, respectively). The 2014 catch rate was toward the low end of expected catch rates for similar lakes (11.5 to 132.6 per trap net). Black bullheads ranged in length from 4.1 to 11.9 inches and averaged 7.7 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
The common carp population has remained stable in Corabelle Lake, with catch rates ranging from 1.2 per trap net in 1996 to 2.7 per trap net in 2008. The 2014 catch rate was within this range at 2.0 per trap net and was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.0 to 5.5 per trap net). Many lengths of common carp were present with lengths ranging from 8.7 to 28.2 inches and averaging 12.7 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
The white sucker catch rate increased from 0.0 in 2008 to 4.8 in 2014. White sucker were between 14.6 and 19.0 inches in length.  <br> 
 <br> 
The 2011 winterkill assessment was the first time that bigmouth buffalo were captured in Corabelle Lake. In 2014, the bigmouth buffalo were still present and were captured at a rate of 0.6 per trap net (n=5). In 2011, bigmouth buffalo averaged 7.8 inches and in 2014 they averaged 24.5 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
Other species captured include orange spotted sunfish (n=90) and yellow bullhead (n=1). This is the first time that yellow bullhead have been sampled in Corabelle Lake (6.1 inches in length). <br> 
 <br> 
Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2009-06-22',  County Name = 'Murray', Lake Name = 'Currant' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/24/2009 Clarity: .8' 
 Narrative = '<p>Currant is a 394-acre lake located southwest of Balaton in Murray County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 9.5 feet and is a class 43 lake.  Currant Lake is managed primarily for walleye while yellow perch, black crappie and northern pike.  An aeration system was installed in 1981 and no winterkill has been document through the winter of 2008-09.  Unfortunately due to a difficult winter in 2009-10, oxygen levels dropped to 0.8 ppm in February of 2010.  The data collected for this assessment was during the summer of 2009 prior to low oxygen levels and results may not be indicative of the actual number of fish present.   <br> 
 <br> 
Based on gill nets used during our fish survey in 2009, the walleye population is less than what we would expect for lakes similar to Currant.  The walleye catch rate could have been affected by the high carp population in Currant.  Carp have a tendency to move prior to walleyes and may have tangled up the gill nets before the walleye in the lake had a chance to be sampled.  The trap nets indicated a population more like what we would see in lakes similar to Currant.  Lengths of walleye caught in our trap nets ranged from 7.1 to 27.3 inches and averaged 15.9 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
As of 2009, Currant Lake has a respectable yellow perch population.  No yellow perch were observed during fish surveys in 2001 and 2005 so adult perch were stocked in 2006.  The gill net catch rate increased from 0.0 in 2005 to 6.7 in 2009.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in our gill nets ranged from 5.4 to 7.0 inches and averaged 5.9 inches.  These fish were likely offspring of the adults stocked in 2006. <br> 
 <br> 
There is an excellent black crappie population in Currant according to our 2009 fish survey.  Lengths of black crappie caught in our trap nets ranged from 5.7 to 9.1 inches and averaged 7.6 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Black bullhead numbers are down a bit from our 2005 fish survey.  Trap net catch rates dropped from 15.4 in 2005 to 2.2 fish per net in 2009.  Lengths of black bullhead caught in our trap nets in 2009 ranged from 6.6 to 9.6 inches and averaged 8.1 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike were stocked as adults in 2004 and fingerlings in 2005 to establish a population which could act as another predator on common carp.  No northern pike have ever been sampled in Currant Lake since starting lake surveys in 1993. <br> 
 <br> 
Other fish sampled during the assessment included bigmouth buffalo, common carp, and orangespotted sunfish. <br> 
 <br> 
To maintain a healthy fishery in Currant Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMPs) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2015-07-06',  County Name = 'Murray', Lake Name = 'First Fulda' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/08/2015 Clarity: 7' 
 Narrative = '<p>INTRODUCTION <br> 
 <br> 
First and Second Fulda Lakes, 179 and 60-acres, are located in Murray County within the City of Fulda.  A channel between the two basins maintains a connection throughout the year; therefore, they are managed as one system.  After several winters of severe winterkill, rough fish such as Common Carp and Black Bullhead were highly abundant in the lakes resulting in poor water quality, limited angling opportunities, and a basin devoid of aquatic vegetation (spawning and nursery habitat for fish).  As a result, a reclamation using rotenone was done in 2008 (following a partial draw down in 2007), to "restart" the lakes.  The following year (2009), the lake was stocked with Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Walleye, and in 2010 was stocked with Black Crappie, Northern Pike, and Yellow Perch.  Despite the reclamation, Common Carp and Black Bullhead have been sampled in Fulda Lakes, likely reentering the system from downstream during a high water event in the fall of 2010 and spring of 2011 due primarily to a failure in the electric barrier and a 100 year precipitation event.  However, their populations have been held in check to date by the abundant predator populations.  Additionally the improvement in water quality and clarity has created a basin with native vegetation that doesn't allow those species the competitive edge to expand and thrive thus far.  Fulda Lakes are managed primarily for Walleye and secondarily for Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike, and Black Crappie.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked every other year beginning in 2011 at a rate of 2 pounds per littoral acre (2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2017).  Northern Pike fingerlings are stocked every other year if they are available.  Other secondary management species sustain their populations through natural reproduction and therefore are not stocked on a regular basis.  A standard survey was conducted the week of July 6, 2015 to monitor fish populations using one gill net and nine trap nets.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
WALLEYE <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye catch rates in Fulda Lake have been highly variable, ranging from 0.5 per gill net in 2004 to 65.0 per gill net in 1996, and averaging 18.5 per gill net since 1984.  Post reclamation, Walleye were captured at rates of 18.0 per gill net in 2011 and 1.0 per gill net in 2015, which is below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (2.3 to 13.3 per gill net).  The trap net catch rate in 2015 was 1.8 per trap net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (0.3 to 2.0 per trap net).  Walleye were 13.3 to 23.0 inches long and averaged 19.9 inches, with 82 percent of Walleye being larger than 19.0 inches.  Despite the lower than desired Walleye catch rate, the intensive stocking regime has been maintained.  It is likely that abundance of the Walleye population was underestimated by gill nets because aquatic vegetation was extremely dense in Fulda Lakes during the summer of 2015.  Gill nets do not fish as effectively when vegetation is dense because vegetation caught in the net makes the net more visible and/or the fish may not have to move around as much to find prey.  Additionally, it is possible that some of the fingerlings leave the lake by going over the dam and downstream to West and East Graham Lakes.   <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
LARGEMOUTH BASS <br> 
 <br> 
The Largemouth Bass in Fulda Lakes are thriving in abundance primarily because of the great habitat in the lakes.  Largemouth Bass were captured at a rate of 81.3 per hour in 2015, down from the 2011 catch rate of 121.0 per hour, but higher than catch rates considered to be "good" at 20-30 per hour.  Sizes of Largemouth Bass were small as lengths ranged from 2.8 to 17.5 inches and averaged 8.5 inches.  Largemouth Bass were plump indicating that they are foraging successfully.  Multiple year classes of Largemouth Bass are present in Fulda Lakes, typical of a stable population.  The aggressive nature of Largemouth Bass should make them easy to catch in the Fulda Lakes.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
NORTHERN PIKE <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike were captured at a rate of 7.0 per gill net and 2.8 per trap net, both of which are well above the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (0.0 to 2.0 per gill net; 0.1 to 0.9 per trap net).  Lengths of Northern Pike ranged from 11.8 to 31.0 inches and averaged 24.4 inches.  Northern Pike were plump, indicating that food is available for them.  With an average length of 24.4 inches, the opportunity to catch good numbers of nice sized pike in the Fulda Lakes is present.  Both summer and winter angling and spearing reports from Fulda also confirm their success. <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
BLUEGILL <br> 
 <br> 
Catch rates of Bluegill have ranged from 0.0 per trap net in 1996 to 21.8 per trap net in 2011, and have averaged 5.3 per trap net since 1984.  Bluegill were scarce in Fulda Lakes prior to the reclamation; however, post-reclamation, Bluegill have been more abundant at 21.8 and 16.7 per trap net in 2011 and 2015, respectively.  The 2015 catch rate was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (1.2 to 20.0 per trap net).  Size of Bluegill was small as lengths ranged from 3.7 to 7.3 inches and averaged 4.9 inches.  Bluegill angling was excellent in the couple of years following the reclamation. Many of the large Bluegill observed in the 2011 survey were likely harvested, which accounts for the lack of large Bluegill in the 2015 survey. Bluegill should attain a larger size with an additional year or two of growth and be available for anglers to harvest.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
BLACK CRAPPIE <br> 
 <br> 
The Black Crappie catch rate increased from 0.2 per trap net in 2011 to 2.1 per trap net in 2015, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (0.7 to 15.3 per trap net).  Size structure of Black Crappies was small as lengths ranged from 3.7 to 7.8 inches and averaged 5.5 inches.  Crappie recruitment tends to be cyclic, where a strong year class is produced every 3 to 5 years, resulting in highly variable catch rates like those observed on Fulda Lakes. Additionally, both bluegill and yellow perch are thriving and likely occupying a similar niche.  As a result of that, the Black Crappie population will likely continue at a low density.   <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
YELLOW PERCH  <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch catch rates in Fulda Lakes have been highly variable, ranging from 0.0 per gill net in 1989 and 2004 to 114.5 per gill net in 1984, and averaging 35.5 per gill net since 1984.  The 2015 catch rate of 46.0 per gill net was similar to the 2011 catch rate of 42.0 per gill net, both of which exceeded the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (3.3 to 30.4 per gill net).  Yellow Perch were small as lengths ranged from 5.7 to 11.0 inches and averaged 6.5 inches with the majority of them (96 percent) being less than 7.0 inches in length.  Yellow Perch naturally reproduce in Fulda Lakes, as it appears there are at least four year classes present in the population.  With an additional year or two of growth, Yellow Perch should attain a size that is acceptable to anglers to harvest.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
OTHER SPECIES <br> 
 <br> 
In the last decade, Common Carp abundance has steadily decreased from 11.0 per gill net in 2004 to 7.0 per gill net in 2011 to 2.0 per gill net in 2015, which is low when compared to similar lakes in the area.  Common Carp lengths were 15.2 to 25.4 inches long and averaged 18.3 inches.  The reclamation, an electric barrier downstream of the lakes, and the intensive predator stocking program are likely helping keep Common Carp numbers in check in Fulda Lakes; however, overtime they will likely establish a self-sustaining population.  If water quality and habitat continues to be excellent in Fulda, along with a robust Bluegill population abundance, and limited stressors during winter (winterkill), it is hopeful their population will remain low.  <br> 
  <br> 
Black Bullhead abundance remained low in the post reclamation era, as they were captured at a rate of 2.9 per trap net, which is below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (11.5 to 132.6 per trap net).  Black Bullhead were 6.0 to 9.2 inches long and averaged 7.7 inches.  The Black Bullhead population is also likely being suppressed by populations of Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass.  <br> 
 <br> 
Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> 
 <br> 
Best management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality.  Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2014-07-07',  County Name = 'Murray', Lake Name = 'Fox' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/07/2014 Clarity: 1.2' 
 Narrative = '<p>INTRODUCTION <br> 
Fox Lake is a 176-acre lake located in Murray County approximately 4.5 miles north of the City of Currie. Fox Lake has a maximum depth of 8.5 feet and has poor water quality (secchi depth=1.2 ft.), likely a result of a highly agricultural watershed. Because of its shallowness and high biological oxygen demand (BOD), frequency of winterkill has been often, as it was opened for liberalized fishing 17 times since 1950. An "Ice Eater" aeration system was installed in the northwest corner of the lake in 2010 to help decrease the frequency and severity of winterkills. Since installation, winterkill on Fox Lake has been minimal. It is believed that there is some sort of connection between Fox Lake and Bloody Lake (although not visually apparent), as water was observed draining west to east under the road during high water in the spring of 2014; however, it is not known if this connection is passable by fish. Currently, Fox Lake is managed as a "pike/perch" fishery, with yellow perch being the primary management species, and northern pike and black crappie being the secondary management species. Northern pike fingerlings are stocked one out of three years, with recent stockings occurring in 2007 and 2010. A population assessment was conducted during the week of July 7, 2014 to monitor fish populations using two gill nets and nine trap nets.   <br> 
 <br> 
YELLOW PERCH <br> 
Since the initial survey done in 1996, yellow perch catch rates have ranged from 14.5 per gill net in 2002 to 77.0 per gill net in 1996. In 2014, yellow perch were captured at a rate of 16.0 per gill net which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net). Yellow perch have not been stocked in the recent past, indicating that this population is able to sustain itself through natural reproduction. Lengths of yellow perch ranged from 5.0 to 11.0 inches and averaged 6.5 inches. Yellow perch were plump, suggesting that a good forage base for yellow perch is available. Establishment of a top-level predator such as northern pike or walleye would help to increase the size structure of the yellow perch population, and provide an additional angling opportunity.  <br> 
 <br> 
BLACK CRAPPPIE  <br> 
Fox Lake has historically been known for its above average crappie angling which was a result of the strong 2001 year class. As a result of this year class, the catch rate of black crappie in 2002 was 76.4 per trap net. As this strong year class died off, it appears little to no reproduction occurred, as the 2014 catch rate fell to 2.1 per trap net. The 2014 catch rate of 2.1 per trap net is near the low end of the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net), indicating that it is a low abundance population in Fox Lake. Four crappies greater than 12.0 inches were sampled in trap nets, indicating that some spawning brood stock is still available in the lake. The other 15 crappies sampled were 4.5 to 5.5 inches long. Despite low population abundance, it appears that natural reproduction is occurring, as a near shore survey conducted during this survey sampled 517 young-of-the-year (YOY) black crappies in 10 seine hauls, which is indicative of a strong year class. If the strong 2014 year class is able to survive through the winter, expect good crappie angling in three to four years.  <br> 
 <br> 
NORTHERN PIKE <br> 
Zero northern pike were sample in the 2014 survey on Fox Lake. Historically, northern pike have occurred in extremely low abundance, with the only one northern pike being sampled in the 1996 survey. If a connection passable by fish existed between Bloody Lake and Fox Lake, one would expect a slightly more abundant northern pike population because Shetek Lake (connected to Bloody Lake) is stocked extensively with northern pike fingerlings. Stocking will continue to try to jump start the northern pike population in Fox Lake.  <br> 
 <br> 
BLACK BULLHEAD <br> 
Despite the lack of a top-level predator in Fox Lake, the black bullhead population has remained in check, being captured at rates of 51.5 per gill net and10.7 per trap net, which are within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes. Lengths of black bullhead in gill nets ranged from 4.8 to 10.9 inches, and in trap nets ranged from 4.6 to 12.3 inches and averaged 7.6 inches. Fox Lake should continue to provide a good angling opportunity for black bullheads.  <br> 
 <br> 
OTHER SPECIES <br> 
Two channel catfish (5.6 and 23.5 inches) were sampled in the 2014 survey marking the first time that they have been documented in Fox Lake. If a passable connection exists, they could have moved from Bloody Lake into Fox Lake, or they were illegally introduced.  To avoid unintended introductions, anglers should be diligent about disposing of unused bait in the trash, and should report unpermitted movement of fish. <br> 
 <br> 
Bigmouth buffalo were captured at a rate of 1.0 per trap net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.2 to 1.04 per trap net). Bigmouth buffalo ranged in length from 16.8 to 25.3 inches and averaged 21.9 inches. Nearly 850 YOY bigmouth buffalo were sampled in the near shore survey, indicating that natural reproduction or immigration of YOY fish is occurring in Fox Lake. <br> 
 <br> 
Other species sampled include brown bullhead, common carp, walleye (N=2), and yellow bullhead. <br> 
 <br> 
Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2013-06-17',  County Name = 'Murray', Lake Name = 'Lime' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/18/2013 Clarity: 1' 
 Narrative = '<p>INTRODUCTION <br> 
Lime Lake is a shallow 316-acre lake adjacent to the City of Avoca in Murray County. Due to its shallowness (maximum depth of 5.0 ft.), Lime Lake has been highly vulnerable to winterkill which has resulted in it being opened to liberalized fishing 18 times since 1950. An aeration system is operated on Lime Lake to reduce the likelihood of winterkill, thereby stabilizing fish populations. Historically, Lime Lake has been managed as a pike/perch fishery because of the extensive network of wetlands that were connected upstream of the lake (Big Slough), which provided ideal spawning areas for northern pike, and because these species tend to have a higher tolerance of low oxygen conditions. Primary management species include northern pike and yellow perch. Northern pike fingerlings are stocked annually at a rate of 10 fish per acre, because Lime Lake is used as a brood source for northern pike rearing activities. The yellow perch population is self-sustaining, as yellow perch have not been stocked in the last decade. Black crappie adults were stocked in 2003 to supplement the existing population, but have not been stocked since. A population assessment was conducted during the week of June 17, 2013 to monitor fish populations using 12 trap nets.  <br> 
 <br> 
NORTHERN PIKE <br> 
Catch rates of northern pike in Lime Lake have varied from 0.6 per trap net in 1992 to 3.1 per trap net in 2007, averaging 1.6 per trap net over that time period. The 2013 northern pike catch rates decreased from the previous survey, going from 3.1 per trap net in 2007 to 0.9 per trap net in 2013. Northern pike ranged in length from 20.0 to 25.6 inches and averaged 22.8 inches. Northern pike were skinny indicating that foraging success may be negatively affected by the turbid water present in Lime Lake. Although trap net catches indicate that the northern pike population may be down in Lime Lake, it is unknown how effectively trap nets sample northern pike during mid-June, and may be underestimating the true abundance of pike in the lake. Evidence from MN DNR brood fish collection in the spring suggests that the northern pike population is more abundant than observed in this survey, as 150 to 200 northern pike are collected in 1 to 2 days annually. Annual stocking of northern pike fingerlings should continue to help supplement the existing population.  <br> 
 <br> 
YELLOW PERCH <br> 
The 2013 yellow perch catch rate of 0.25 per trap net was below the expected range of catch rates (0.3 to 3.8 per trap net) for similar lakes. Yellow perch catch rates have varied from 0.0 per trap net in 2001 to 4.2 per trap net in 1997, and averaged 1.9 per trap net since 1987. Yellow perch ranged from 5.8 to 6.1 inches and averaged 5.9 inches. Sixty-eight young-of-the-year (just hatched in the spring) perch were sampled in a near shore seining and backpack electrofishing survey on July 1, 2013, indicating that some natural reproduction occurred. Yellow perch populations tend to fluctuate, where years of high catch rates are followed by years of low catch rates; therefore, the low catch rate observed in 2013 was not alarming and should not adversely impact the yellow perch population.   <br> 
 <br> 
BLACK CRAPPIE  <br> 
Black crappie catch rates have varied from 0.0 per trap net in 2001 to 23.9 per trap net in 2007, and have averaged 5.3 per trap net since 1987. In 2013, black crappies were captured at a rate of 1.9 per trap net which is within the expected catch range (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net) for lakes similar to Lime Lake, but was a drastic decrease in catch rate since 2007 (23.9 per trap net). Similar to yellow perch, black crappie populations tend to be highly variable where a strong year class is produced every 3-5 years, often resulting in a boom or bust fishery. Lime Lake black crappies were large in 2013, having an average length of 10.5 inches, with the largest crappie being 12.6 inches in length. Twenty-two percent of crappies sample were 12 inches or bigger. It appears that Lime Lake has a relatively stable population of black crappies that is self-sustaining and could provide an additional angling opportunity in the future.  <br> 
 <br> 
BLACK BULLHEAD <br> 
Black bullhead abundance has steadily declined in Lime Lake, ranging from a high catch rate of 544.3 per trap net in 1987 to a low of 11.4 per trap net in 2013, averaging 146.5 per trap net over that time frame. The 2013 catch rate of 11.4 per trap net was below the expected range (11.5 to 132.6 per trap net) of catch rates for lakes similar to Lime Lake, indicating that bullhead numbers may be low. Black bullheads were relatively small, ranging in length from 5.9 to 10.2 inches and averaging 7.6 inches. The extreme turbidity in Lime Lake coupled with the potentially low abundance of black bullheads may be some of the factors affecting the weights of northern pike, as black bullheads are an important prey resource for northern pike in southern Minnesota lakes.  <br> 
 <br> 
COMMON CARP <br> 
Catch rates of common carp prior to 2007 commonly exceeded the expected range of catch rates (1.0 to 5.5 per trap net) for similar lakes, as catch rates ranged from 7.3 per trap net in 1987 to 31.0 per trap net in 2001 and averaged 20.1 per trap net from 1987 to 2001. In 2007 and 2013, the catch rates fell to expected levels at 3.0 and 4.8 per trap net, respectively. Common carp size structure was large as lengths of common carp ranged from 13.3 to 30.0 inches and averaged 19.7 inches. The carp population in Lime Lake appears to be well established as multiple year classes were present.  <br> 
 <br> 
OTHER SPECIES <br> 
Three walleyes were captured in 2013 which is the first time that they have been documented in Lime Lake. The walleyes ranged from 15.6 to 16.8 inches and averaged 16.1 inches. Lime Lake is connected to the West Fork of the Des Moines River via Lime Creek, which is likely how walleyes moved into the lake.  <br> 
 <br> 
Bigmouth buffalo were captured at a rate of 1.7 per trap net in 2013, which is high compared to similar lakes. Bigmouth buffalo ranged in length from 16.8 inches to 25.8 inches and averaged 21.2 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
Other species sampled included channel catfish (0.4 per trap net), white sucker (0.3 per trap net), and yellow bullhead (0.1 per trap net).  <br> 
 <br> 
Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> 
 <br> 
Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> 
 <br> 
Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> 
 <br> 
Best management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake. High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality. Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2013-06-10',  County Name = 'Murray', Lake Name = 'Wilson' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/10/2013 Clarity: 2.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>INTRODUCTION <br> 
Lake Wilson is a 170-acre lake located near the City of Lake Wilson in southwest Murray County. Lake Wilson is relatively shallow, having a maximum depth of 8.0 feet. At the time of the assessment, water clarity was 2.5 feet. Lake Wilson is highly productive, likely a result of excessive nutrient runoff from the agriculture dominated watershed and from the impervious surfaces in the City of Lake Wilson. Low dissolve oxygen readings have been documented during several years in Lake Wilson, with the last suspected winterkill occurring during the winter of 2000 and 2001. Because of the likeliness to winterkill, management species were switched from largemouth bass and bluegill to yellow perch and walleye. Lake Wilson is aerated, which has aided in stabilizing the fish community. Currently, yellow perch is the primary management species in Lake Wilson, with black crappie and walleye being managed secondarily. The yellow perch population has been self-sustaining, as they have not been stocked since 1993. Black crappies are also mostly self-sustaining, with the last stocking occurring in 2003 and 2005. Extensive walleye stocking has occurred in Lake Wilson as fingerlings have been stocked in 2005, 2008, and 2011. A population assessment was conducted during the week of June 10, 2013 to monitor fish populations using two gill nets and six trap nets.  <br> 
 <br> 
YELLOW PERCH  <br> 
Yellow perch catch rates had been on the upswing since 2001 when they were captured at a rate of 25.0 per gill net. Similarly, in 2007, yellow perch abundance was the highest ever documented in Lake Wilson at 58.5 per gill net. In 2013, zero yellow perch were sampled in gill nets or trap nets. Yellow perch populations tend to be highly variable, which is reflected in the catches of yellow perch in Lake Wilson. Yellow perch populations can follow a pattern where a strong year class is produced and then followed by one to two years of little to no reproduction, resulting in a boom or bust fishery.  Boom and bust fish populations can be put under more stress if they are overharvested, or if they are utilized as prey, things that yellow perch could experience in Lake Wilson.  <br> 
 <br> 
BLACK CRAPPIE <br> 
Black crappie trap net catch rates have varied greatly in Lake Wilson, ranging from 0.2 per trap net in 2013 to 13.6 per trap net in 1989 and averaging 6.9 per trap net over that same time frame. Three black crappies were sampled in 2013 gill nets and trap nets, which is the lowest number sampled since surveys began. The 2013 catch rate of 0.2 per trap net is well below the expected range of catch rates (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net) for similar lakes.  <br> 
 <br> 
WALLEYE <br> 
Walleyes were first stocked in Lake Wilson in 1999, as management practices switched from a largemouth bass and bluegill fishery to species that are slightly more tolerant of low oxygen conditions. Since the initial stocking of walleyes, catch rates have varied from 0.0 per gill net in 2001 to 24.5 per gill net in 2007. Since the record high catch rate observed in 2007, catch rates have come back down to more realistic levels. In 2013, walleyes were captured at a rate of 3.5 per gill net, which is in the expected range of catch rates (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net) for similar lakes. Trap net catch rates, also indicated a decent population of walleyes, as they were captured at a rate of 2.3 per trap net which is high when compared to similar lakes. Walleyes were large, ranging in length from 14.2 to 28.7 inches and averaging 20.1 inches. Two ages of walleyes were sampled (age-2 and age-5) and corresponded to years in which stocking occurred (2008 and 2011). Walleyes appear to grow fast in Lake Wilson, as lengths averaged 10.2 inches at age-1, 13.5 inches at age-2, 16.0 inches at age-3, 18.6 inches at age-4, and 20.2 inches at age-5. Walleyes were plump, indicating that sufficient prey is available in Lake Wilson. Although the catch rate is down from 2007, the walleye population in Lake Wilson appears to be relatively stable, as multiple year classes and multiple sizes of walleyes were present.       <br> 
 <br> 
BLACK BULLHEAD <br> 
The 2013 black bullhead catch rate (89.0 per gill net) was within the expected range (30.3 to 150.6 per gill net) of catch rates for similar lakes. Black bullheads ranged in size from 5.0 to 15.6 inches and averaged 9.0 inches. Since the last survey in 2007, size structure of black bullheads has increased. Both gill net and trap net catch rates of black bullhead were down from the 2007 survey, which could be the result of the abundant walleye population documented in 2007, or the result of a partial winterkill that may have occurred since the last survey.  <br> 
 <br> 
COMMON CARP <br> 
Common carp have been absent in Lake Wilson since surveys began in 1989. In 2013, common carp were relatively abundant at 13.5 per gill net, which is high when compared to similar lakes, and 18.8 per trap net, which is very high compared to similar lakes. Common carp ranged from 12.8 to 18.5 inches and averaged 15.8 inches in length. Common carp likely got into Lake Wilson during a high water event in the spring of 2012, when they were documented coming through an agricultural drainage (tiling) near the baseball fields by the northwest end of the lake. <br> 
 <br> 
OTHER SPECIES <br> 
Two channel catfish were captured in gill nets, which is the first time that channel catfish have been sampled in Lake Wilson. The channel catfish were 18.9 and 19.2 inches in length. Channel catfish can be effective at controlling bullhead populations, so it will be interesting to see how the channel catfish population in Lake Wilson affects the black bullhead population. Channel catfish also likely entered the lake during the high water event in the spring of 2012. <br> 
 <br> 
White suckers were captured at rates of 15.5 per gill net and 2.3 per trap net, both record high catch rates for Lake Wilson. White suckers ranged in length from 10.4 to 19.3 inches and averaged 15.0 inches. <br> 
  <br> 
Other species sampled included one 27.2 inch northern pike, and one yellow bullhead.  <br> 
 <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2015-06-01',  County Name = 'Nobles', Lake Name = 'East Graham' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/04/2015 Clarity: 1.2' 
 Narrative = '<p>INTRODUCTION <br> 
 <br> 
East Graham Lake is a 604-acre lake located about one mile south of the Town of Kinbrae in Nobles County.  East Graham Lake has a maximum depth of 8.0 feet, and has turbid water.  East Graham Lake is considered to be one of the headwaters of the West Fork of the Des Moines River, resulting in immigration and emigration of fish from the river.  East Graham Lake has historically been susceptible to low dissolved oxygen levels, as it was opened to liberalized fishing 16 times from 1952 to 1982.  More recently, East Graham Lake experienced low dissolved oxygen levels during the winter of 2009-2010 and the winter of 2013-2014; however, no significant winterkills were reported.  The Power House Ice Eater system replaced the old Helixor system in 2007 and continues to be operated by the Nobles County Parks Department.  East Graham Lake is managed primarily for Walleye and Northern Pike and secondarily for Black Crappie.  Walleye are stocked at a rate of 1000 per littoral acre, two out of three years (i.e., 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016).  Northern Pike and Black Crappie have not been stocked in the last decade because they were able to maintain their populations through natural reproduction, or through immigration from connected waterbodies.  East Graham Lake was surveyed the week of June 1, 2015 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and eight trap nets. <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
WALLEYE <br> 
 <br> 
Catch rates of Walleye on East Graham Lake have been highly variable, ranging from 3.7 per gill net in 2003 to 33.7 per gill net in 1999 and averaging 13.4 per gill net since 1986.  In 2015, Walleye were captured at a rate of 8.0 per gill net, which is an increase from the 2011 catch rate of 7.3 per gill net, and was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the Windom management area (2.3 to 13.3 per gill net).  Lengths of Walleye in gill nets ranged from 7.7 to 20.8 inches and averaged 13.3 inches.  Eighty-six percent of the Walleye sampled in trap nets and gill nets were 12.0 to 16.0 inches in length and were age-2 fish from the 2013 fry stocking.  Other year classes sampled included Walleye from 2014 (age-1, N=2) and 2011 (age-4, N=1), which were non-stocked years.  The likelihood of natural reproduction is low, so these fish from non-stocked years likely emigrated from West Graham Lake which was stocked with Walleye fry in 2011 and 2014.  Lengths at age were 9.2 inches at age-1, and 12.8 inches at age-2, which is slightly slower growth than what is observed on other similar lakes around the state (11.0 inches at age-1 and 14.3 inches at age-2).  The 2013 year class should provide a decent angling opportunity in the near future.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
NORTHERN PIKE <br> 
 <br> 
The Northern Pike catch rate in East Graham Lake in 2015 was 8.3 per gill net, which is the highest recorded catch rate for this lake, and nearly four times higher than what we would expect for lakes similar to East Graham in the Windom management area.  Previous catch rates have ranged from 0.0 per gill net in 1991 to 4.0 per gill net in 1999 and 2003, and have averaged 3.5 per gill net since 1986.  Northern Pike have not been stocked in East Graham Lake since 1994, suggesting that this population sustains itself through natural reproduction.  Several wetlands are present around East Graham Lake which would provide good spawning habitat if water levels are high enough for Northern Pike to move into them during the spawning season. Additionally, connection to the West Fork of the Des Moines River, West Graham Lake, and outflow from Fulda Lake, likely increases Northern Pike abundance.  Lengths of Northern Pike captured in gill nets and trap nets ranged from 9.8 to 27.7 inches and averaged 21.4 inches. Northern Pike are aggressive fish that can easily be caught at times. Northern Pike angling on East Graham Lake should be good in the near future.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
BLACK CRAPPIE  <br> 
 <br> 
Since 2007, the Black Crappie catch rate has declined from 68.0 per trap net, to 2.6 per trap net in 2011, to 0.5 per trap net in 2015.  The 2015 catch rate of 0.5 per trap net was the lowest observed catch rate on East Graham Lake and is below the expected range of catch rates for lakes in the Windom management area (0.7 to 15.3 per trap net).  Lengths of Black Crappie ranged from 7.6 to 11.2 inches and averaged 10.3 inches. The decreased abundance of black crappie is likely a result of a lack of natural reproduction in recent years.  Black crappie natural reproduction tends to be highly variable and is often characterized as cyclic, with strong year classes reoccurring every three to five years.  Many times the abiotic conditions at the time of spawning determine success.  Typically, crappies key in on wind protected bays with some emergent aquatic vegetation like cattails for reproduction.  This variable and cyclic recruitment often results in a "boom-or-bust" crappie fishery, where years of increased angler catch rates are followed by years of decreased angler catch rates. <br>

 <br> 
BLACK BULLHEAD <br> 
 <br> 
The Black Bullhead catch rate in trap nets increased from 31.0 per trap net in 2011 to 144.9 per trap net in 2015, and in gill nets increased from 62.7 per gill net in 2011 to 87.0 per gill net in 2015.  The trap net catch rate exceeded the normal catch rates for similar lakes (11.5 to 132.6 per trap net), and the gill net catch rate was within the expected range of catch rates (30.3 to 150.6 per gill net).  Lengths of Black Bullhead ranged from 5.1 to 13.3 inches and averaged 8.6 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
OTHER SPECIES <br> 
 <br> 
Catch rates of Common Carp in gill nets and trap nets were down from the 2011 survey, decreasing from 8.7 per gill net in 2011 to 3.7 per gill net in 2015, and from 9.2 per trap net in 2011 to 2.5 per trap net in 2015.  Lengths of Common Carp ranged from 9.9 to 28.2 inches and averaged 17.0 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
The Bigmouth Buffalo gill net catch rate of 36.3 per gill net was the highest recorded catch rate on East Graham Lake.  It greatly exceeded the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.8 to 7.0 per gill net).  Lengths of Bigmouth Buffalo ranged from 8.6 to 24.2 inches and averaged 12.0 inches.  Eighty percent of gill netted Bigmouth Buffalo were between 11.0 and 13.0 inches, and only four exceeded 18.0 inches.  While Bigmouth Buffalo are not a highly sought after fish by the hook and line angler, they are a native fish and prized by commercial fisherman.    <br> 
 <br> 
The 2015 Channel Catfish catch rate of 2.7 per gill net was consistent with the 2011 catch rate of 3.3 per gill net.  Channel Catfish lengths ranged from 14.2 to 19.1 inches and averaged 17.3 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
Other species sampled included White Sucker (N= 29), Yellow Perch (N=14), Quillback (N=3), and Yellow Bullhead (N=2).  <br> 
 <br> 
Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> 
 <br> 
Best management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality.  Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2014-06-02',  County Name = 'Nobles', Lake Name = 'Indian' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/03/2014 Clarity: 1.9' 
 Narrative = '<p>INTRODUCTION <br> 
Indian Lake is a 204-acre lake located two miles to the southwest of the City of Round Lake in Nobles County. Indian Lake has a maximum depth of 6.0 ft. and a watershed to lake ratio of 38:1 which means that for every 1 acre of water on the lake there is 38 acres of upland drainage.  Indian Lake has a relatively large watershed. Runoff from surrounding agricultural fields has resulted in poor water quality in Indian Lake, as indicated by a Secchi depth of 1.9 feet. Despite its shallowness, Indian Lake rarely experiences low dissolved oxygen levels in the winter which has allowed a diverse fish community to establish. Indian Lake is managed primarily for black and white crappie, and secondarily for walleye and northern pike. The crappie populations have sustained themselves through natural reproduction, but walleye and northern pike are stocked to maintain populations. Walleye fingerlings are stocked every other year (2009, 2011, 2013, and 2015) and northern pike fingerlings are stocked every third year (2005, 2008, 2011, 2014, and 2017). A population assessment was conducted during the week of June 2, 2014 to monitor the fish community in Indian Lake.  <br> 
 <br> 
WHITE CRAPPIE <br> 
Over the past decade, the white crappie population has been stable, as variation in catch rates has been minimal (25.1 per trap net in 2004, 22.9 per trap net in 2010, and 18.1 per trap net in 2014). Prior to 2004, catch rates were highly variable ranging from 5.5 per trap net in 1996 to 107.4 per trap net in 2000. The catch rate of 18.1 per trap net in 2014 is much greater than what would be expected in lakes similar to Indian. The majority (74 percent) of the white crappie sampled were from 9.0 to 10.5 inches in length. Overall, lengths ranged from 4.1 to 15.0 inches and averaged 9.6 inches. White crappies were plump, indicating that prey is readily available. Indian Lake has the potential to produce large white crappies, as evidenced by the sampling of 9 fish over 12 inches, with one of those being 15 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
BLACK CRAPPIE <br> 
Black crappie abundance has been highly variable in Indian Lake, ranging from 0.4 per trap net in 2014 to 19.3 per trap net in 2000. The 2014 catch rate of 0.4 per trap net is well below the long term average of 9.0 per trap net, and is below what would be expected in similar lakes. The low abundance of black crappies in Indian Lake may be a result of the high abundance of white crappies. The two species of crappies can coexist, but one of the species usually will occur at a lower abundance. The three black crappies that were captured in trap nets were large, ranging in length from 12.8 to 13.5 inches and averaging 13.3 inches. The gill net catch of black crappie indicated the presence of additional year classes, as gill netted crappies ranged from 4.4 to 9.7 inches and averaged 6.8 inches. Crappies were plump indicating that prey is readily available. Black crappies are present at low numbers in this system, but the angler can expect the size of black crappies to be large.  <br> 
 <br> 
WALLEYE <br> 
In 2014, walleyes were captured at rate of 2.7 per gill net, which is within the historic range of catch rates (1.7 per gill net in 2010 to 17.7 per gill net in 2010) , and within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.3 to 18.1 per gill net). The 2014 catch rate is at the low end of expected catch rates, indicating a low abundance population. Walleyes from gill nets ranged in length from 10.1 to 21.1 inches and averaged 16.3 inches. Walleyes captured in trap nets were smaller, ranging from 6.9 to 8.5 inches and averaging 7.5 inches. Three year classes of walleyes were sampled (age-1, age-3, and age-5), all corresponding to years that fingerlings were stocked (2013, 2011, and 2009). This indicates that natural reproduction is rare in Indian Lake and that the walleye population is maintained by stocking. Mean back-calculated lengths at age were 8.2 inches for age-1, 13.2 inches for age-2, 15.4 inches for age-3, 17.9 inches for age-4, and 19.3 inches for age-5, indicating slow growth for ages 1 to 3 and faster growth for ages 4 and 5, when compared to average values of mean length at age for similar lakes. Walleyes sampled corresponded to each stocking event, suggesting that fingerling stocking is somewhat successful in keeping multiple year classes present in this system. The current stocking regime will likely continue, as strong year classes that have occurred in the past have been the result of fingerling stocking. In addition, walleye fingerling stocking is the most successful strategy when an abundant crappie population is present.  <br> 
 <br> 
NORTHERN PIKE <br> 
Stocking of northern pike fingerlings has occurred every three years since 2005 in Indian Lake (2005, 2008, 2011 and 2014). Despite stocking efforts, zero northern pike were captured in 2014, which is the lowest catch rate observed since surveys began on Indian Lake in 1987. Prior to the beginning of stocking in 2005, northern pike catch rates were higher at 4.5, 6.0, 2.7, and 3.3 per gill net in 1987, 1996, 2000, and 2004, respectively. The higher catch rates prior to stocking suggest that higher quality spawning habitat was available. Northern pike likely made spawning runs into streams and ditches that had good spawning habitat and were connected to Indian Lake. The northern pike fingerlings that are being stocked once every three years are not showing up in the catches; therefore, consideration will be given to the altering the frequency and/or the size of northern pike stocked.  <br> 
 <br> 
YELLOW PERCH <br> 
The 2014 catch rate of 5.0 per gill net is within the expected range of catch rates of similar lakes, but is the lowest catch rate observed since surveys began in 1987. Yellow perch catch rates have varied from 36.5 per gill net in 1987 to 5.0 per gill net in 2014, and have averaged 14.7 per gill net since 1987. Yellow perch ranged in length from 7.6 to 10.9 inches and averaged 9.2 inches. In an effort to increase the brood stock of yellow perch in Indian Lake, 750 pre-spawn adult yellow perch were stocked in April of 2014.  <br> 
 <br> 
OTHER SPECIES <br> 
Over the last decade, black bullhead catch rates have been below the expected catch rates for similar lakes. In 2014, the trend of low black bullhead abundance continued as bullheads were captured at a rate of 2.8 per trap net. Black bullheads ranged in length from 10.0 to 13.5 inches and averaged 11.6 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
Common carp abundance increased from 1.0 per gill net in 2010 to 3.3 per gill net in 2014, which is the second highest catch rate of common carp since surveys began in 1987. The 2014 catch rate is higher than the long term average of 2.4 per gill net, but within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.0 to 13.8 per gill net). Common carp lengths in trap nets and gill nets ranged from 8.6 to 35.9 inches, with most of them being greater than 25.0 inches in length.  <br> 
 <br> 
The 2014 catch rate of bigmouth buffalo (3.3 per gill net) was the highest catch rate observed since surveys began in 1987, but was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.8 to 7.0 per gill net). Bigmouth buffalo ranged in length from 7.7 to 27.6 inches and averaged 20.5 inches.   <br> 
 <br> 
Freshwater drum were first sampled in Indian Lake in the 1996 survey. Since then, the abundance of freshwater drum has consistently stayed within the expected range of catch rates for both trap nets (0.2 to 3.3 per trap net) and gill nets (0.5 to 8.3 per trap net) for similar lakes. The 2014 catch rates were also within this range at 5.7 per gill net and 0.4 per trap net. Freshwater drum can be problematic because they can predate on game fish, or compete with game fish for prey resources.  <br> 
 <br> 
One, 25.2 inch channel catfish was sampled in the gill net. This is the first time a channel catfish has been sampled since 2000.  <br> 
 <br> 
Other species sampled included white sucker (N=26). <br> 
 <br> 
Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> 
 <br> 
Best management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake. High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality. Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2012-06-04',  County Name = 'Nobles', Lake Name = 'Kinbrae' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/04/2012 Clarity: 1.8' 
 Narrative = '<p>INTRODUCTION <br> 
 <br> 
Kinbrae Lake, located near the town of Kinbrae in Nobles County, is a class 43 lake.  Immigration of fish into Kinbrae Lake rarely happens as there is little connection to downstream waterways.  In fact, based on historical records, Kinbrae Lake has never had common carp which is further documentation of the lack of connectivity to downstream waterways.  Kinbrae Lake has been surveyed 4 times by DNR Fisheries going back to 1994.  A survey was conducted during the first week of June in 2012 with gill nets, trap nets, and electrofishing. <br> 
 <br> 
NORTHERN PIKE <br> 
 <br> 
The northern pike catch per unit effort (CPUE) in gill nets was 2.0 fish per set, which was lower than the 2006 survey of 4.3 fish per set.  Total lengths of northern pike ranged from 22 to 25 inches and averaged 23 inches.  Northern pike fingerlings (approximately 1,200 fish each time) have been stocked in 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2010.  Northern pike fingerlings are stocked in even numbered years but local production in 2012 was a bust due to drought so no fingerlings were stocked.  Given the stocking records and typical growth of northern pike in the Windom Area, it is likely that the fish caught in 2012 are from the 2010 stocking.  Given the yellow perch numbers in the survey, it would appear there is ample forage even though water clarity can be low at times limiting the northern pike's ability to find prey.   <br> 
 <br> 
YELLOW PERCH <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch numbers have never been higher in Kinbrae Lake.  The total catch in gill nets in 2012 averaged 40.0 fish per set compared to 25.3 fish per set in 2006.  Total lengths ranged from 5 to 9 inches with an average size of 7 inches.  It is likely if you are targeting yellow perch, you may need to put up with catching some smaller fish until you get some "keepers". <br> 
 <br> 
LARGEMOUTH BASS <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth numbers were as expected but lower than the 2006 survey.  Total lengths of largemouth bass ranged from 6 to 16 inches with an average size of 10 inches.  Surprisingly there were 7 age groups of largemouth bass based on ageing data from scales collected.  There is some error with ageing scales, but 7 different ages present does indicate that there is some natural reproduction occurring with good survival of largemouth bass through winter.  If winterkill does occur on Kinbrae, it would most likely occurs first with the largemouth because they are very sensitive to low dissolved oxygen.  Anglers definitely have a chance of catching largemouth bass in Kinbrae Lake.   <br> 
 <br> 
WALLEYE <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye numbers have not changed substantially since the 2006 survey despite several stockings of walleye fingerlings.  Nearly 3000 walleye fingerlings have been stocked since 2006.  The 2006 survey sampled 2.3 walleye per gill net compared to 3.0 walleye per gill net in 2012.  So although the number of walleye is better, it is not substantially better.  All of the walleye sampled were greater than 16.5 inches and age analysis indicates they were from the 2007 stocking.  The next stocking will be in the fall of 2013.  If an angler catches a walleye in Kinbrae, it will likely be a nice "keeper" walleye. <br> 
 <br> 
BLUEGILL <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill numbers are similar to years past but the pumpkinseed numbers are up.  Total lengths of pumpkinseed range from 3.5 to 8.5 inches and had an average size of 6 inches.  Sunfish can be caught in Kinbrae but the odds are high that you will catch a pumpkinseed before a bluegill. <br> 
 <br> 
BLACK CRAPPIE <br> 
 <br> 
Prior to the 2012 survey, a total of only 10 black crappie had been sampled in trap nets and gill nets combined during all historical surveys.  The black crappie catch rate in trap nets in 2012 was 12.8 fish per set which was twice the expected catch rate.  DNR Fisheries has not stocked black crappie and they are likely a result of illegal stocking.  Total lengths of black crappie ranged from 5 to 11 inches with an average of 8 inches.  There are some nice black crappie in Kinbrae that would likely provide some good fishing at times. <br> 
 <br> 
SUMMARY <br> 
 <br> 
To maintain a healthy fishery in Summit Lake; we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMP's) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity which can decimate fish populations and lead to carp and bullhead dominated lakes.  Any improvement within the watershed will go a long way toward improving the fish community in the lake. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2009-06-01',  County Name = 'Nobles', Lake Name = 'Ocheda' 
 Lake Clarity = '' 
 Narrative = '<p>Ocheda is a 1,700-acre lake located 2 miles south of Worthington in Nobles County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 5 feet, 21 miles of shoreline, and is a class 41 lake.  The lake is managed primarily for northern pike while yellow perch and walleye are managed secondarily.  Local riparian owners and the Okabena-Ocheda Watershed District met in 2010 to develop a plan that would improve the water quality in Ocheda Lake.  Lowering water levels and reducing common carp populations were some of the topics discussed at the meeting.  An aeration system is operated on the lake to help prevent winterkill but was not operated during the winter of 2009-10.  Oxygen Levels did drop below 2 ppm in February of 2010. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike numbers are high when compared to other lakes with similar morphology and chemical characteristics.  Lengths of northern pike caught in our gill nets ranged from 15.8 to 25.2 inches and averaged 20.9 inches.  Trap nets sampled some larger northern pike.  Lengths of northern pike caught in our trap nets in 2009 ranged from 14.9 to 36.2 inches with and averaged 25.0 inches.   <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch numbers were similar to other lakes like Ocheda.  Lengths of yellow perch caught in our gill nets ranged from 6.7 to 10.0 inches and averaged 8.1 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye numbers are low when compared to other lakes like Ocheda.  All walleye caught in our gill nets were age 3 and likely originated from a fry stocking in Okabena Lake in 2006.  High water levels during the spring of 2006 may have allowed walleye fry to drift over the dam and eventually end up in Ocheda Lake.   <br> 
 <br> 
Carp have historically been a problem in Ocheda and is likely one of the major causes of the poor water quality in the lake.  The carp population is extremely high with the gill net catch rates being four times higher than what we would expect in lakes similar to Ocheda.   Lengths of carp caught in our gill nets ranged from 4.9 to 21.5 inches and averaged 16.9 inches.  Lengths of carp caught in our trap nets ranged from 15.8 to 28.4 inches and averaged 20.8 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
If you are looking for a meal of spring bullhead, Ocheda would be a good choice.  Lengths of black bullhead caught in our trap nets ranged from 7.0 to 11.3 inches and averaged 8.0 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Other fish sampled during our population assessment included bigmouth buffalo, black crappie, and white crappie. <br> 
 <br> 
To maintain a healthy fishery in Ocheda Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMPs) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2014-08-18',  County Name = 'Nobles', Lake Name = 'Okabena' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/18/2014 Clarity: .9' 
 Narrative = '<p>INTRODUCTION <br> 
Lake Okabena is a 751-acre lake located within the City of Worthington in Nobles County. Lake Okabena has a watershed to lake ratio of 19:1, meaning it receives drainage from over 14,000 acres of agricultural row crops and impervious surfaces from part of the City of Worthington. Lake Okabena has a mean depth of 8.0 feet and a maximum depth of 16.0 feet, which, until 1985, was maintained by dredging. Residential development has disturbed and altered some of Lake Okabena's shoreline; however, the majority of its shoreline is owned by the City of Worthington, which allows ample opportunity for shoreline anglers. In areas with residential development, lawns are typically maintained to the water's edge and shorelines are altered with rock riprap, thereby disrupting the natural riparian buffer. Excessive nutrient runoff from lawns, impervious services, and agricultural fields likely contribute to Lake Okabena's turbid water (Secchi depth = 0.9 feet). The primary management species in Lake Okabena are walleye and channel catfish, and the secondary management species are black crappie, white crappie, bluegill, and yellow perch. Walleye fry have been stocked at a rate of 1,000 per littoral acre two out of three years since 2006 (2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2015). In cooperation with the Southwest Minnesota Fishing Club, pre-spawn bluegill, largemouth bass, northern pike, or black crappie are stocked annually into drainable wetlands (Worthington Pond 1 and Worthington Pond 2) that are connected to Lake Okabena via Whiskey Ditch. Water is retained in the ponds until early October, which allows the young-of-the-year (YOY) fish to grow to a size conducive for survival, and then is drained into Whiskey Ditch and eventually into Lake Okabena. The amount of fish produced in a year in these ponds has not been quantified, but it is likely that this operation provides some benefit to fish populations in Lake Okabena. A population assessment was conducted during the week of August 18, 2014 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and 12 trap nets.   <br> 
 <br> 
WALLEYE <br> 
Walleye were captured at a rate of 12.3 per gill net in 2014, which is within the long term range of catch rates observed in Lake Okabena (4.3 per gill net in 1986 to 36.5 per gill net in 1982) and is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.2 to 15.3 per gill net). The trap net catch rate in 2014 was 3.6 per trap net, which is greater than the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.3 to 1.7 per trap net). Since 2006, walleye fry have been stocked at a rate of 1,000 fry per littoral acre, two out of three years. This strategy has produced catch rates that have been well above the upper quartile of catch rates in 2006 (34.0 per gill net) and 2008 (23.3 per gill net), and just below the upper quartile of catch rates in 2010 (14.7 per gill net) and 2014 (12.3 per gill net), indicating that this stocking strategy has been very successful at maintaining an abundant walleye population. A population abundance model was used to estimate the 2014 population size for Lake Okabena based on gill net catches of walleye. The model estimated that there are potentially 27,211 walleyes in Lake Okabena. Walleyes captured in gill nets ranged from 8.0 to 22.4 inches in length and averaged 13.0 inches. Trap netted walleyes ranged in length from 7.4 to 28.4 inches and averaged 11.0 inches. Eight year classes of walleye were sampled (2003, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013) including some years that do not correspond to stocking events. This indicates that some natural reproduction may be occurring, albeit limited. Age classes that do not correspond to stocking events include age-3 (2011) and age-6 (2008). The 2013 year class (age-1) was the most abundant and was a major component of the walleye population in Lake Okabena. Growth of walleye has improved since the last survey done in 2010 lengths at age increased from 10.0 inches at age-2 and 12.0 inches at age-3 in 2010 to 12.0 inches at age-2 and 14.1 inches at age-3 in 2014. Increased growth could be the result of higher prey availability, particularly freshwater drum (23.0 per gill net), which are relatively new to this system (first captured in 2010), and bigmouth buffalo (22.7 per gill net and 11.5 per trap net), which prior to the 2014 survey, had occurred in low abundance in Lake Okabena (less than 1.0 per gill net and 0.3 per trap net). Yellow perch are also one of the major prey items for walleye; however, the increase in walleye growth rates is likely not connected to yellow perch, as the 2014 yellow perch catch rate of 23.0 per gill net remained about the same as the 2010 yellow perch catch rate of 24.7 per gill net, as did their size structure. Despite increased growth rates, walleyes were skinny. A strong 2013 year class should provide some good walleye angling within the next couple of years when they reach a size desirable to anglers.  <br> 
 <br> 
CHANNEL CATFISH <br> 
The channel catfish catch rates have been highly variable in Lake Okabena, ranging from 0.5 per gill net in 2004 to 106.3 per gill net in 1986. In 2014, channel catfish were captured at a rate of 20.0 per gill net; down from the 2010 catch rate of 43.0 per gill net, but slightly higher than the long term average of 18.9 per gill net. Channel catfish ranged in length from 16.1 to 23.2 inches and averaged 20.2 inches. Three year classes of channel catfish were sampled including 2004, 2005, and 2006. Fifty-seven percent of the catfish sampled were age-10, which corresponds to the most recent stocking in 2004. The presence of the 2005 (40 percent of the sample) and 2006 (35 percent of the sample) year classes indicate that some natural reproduction by channel catfish occurs in Lake Okabena, and may be enough to sustain the population. Channel catfish are managed in Lake Okabena to control the black bullhead population. When channel catfish abundance is low, black bullhead abundance tends to be higher, and vice versa. Channel catfish catch rates have been high in the last three surveys 30.7, 43.0, and 20.0 per gill net in 2008, 2010, and 2014, respectively. Consequently, black bullhead gill net catch rates have been below 2.0 per gill net in those surveys. Lake Okabena's channel catfish population should provide a good fishing opportunity for years to come.   <br> 
 <br> 
CRAPPIES <br> 
Characteristic of crappie populations, black and white crappie catch rates in Lake Okabena have been highly variable with catch rates ranging from 0.9 per trap net in 1982 to 68.1 per trap net in 2002 for black crappies, and 0.1 per trap net in 2008 to 44.3 per trap net in 1982 for white crappies. The 2014 black crappie catch rate of 36.7 per trap net was the third highest catch rate since 1982 and was much higher than the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.0 to 12.3 per trap net). The 2014 white crappie catch rate of 1.0 per trap net was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (0.5 to 15.9 per trap net). The low abundance of white crappie in Lake Okabena may be a result of the high abundance of black crappie. The two species of crappie can coexist, but one of the species usually will occur at a lower abundance. Black crappie were small, with most of them (99 percent) being between 5.9 and 7.8 inches in length. Only two of the black crappie sampled were greater than 10 inches in length. White crappie were also small, ranging in length from 6.9 to 8.2 inches. Otoliths from three black crappies were aged and were estimated to be age-2 (2012 year class). The narrow range of lengths of black crappie indicates that most of them are likely from the same year class in 2012 (age-2). If growth of black crappie continues to be good, a highly abundant population should be available to anglers within the next couple of years.  <br> 
 <br> 
BLUEGILL <br> 
The 2014 bluegill catch rate was 0.4 per trap net, which is below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.1 to 14.8 per trap net), and the lowest observed catch rate since 2004 (0.2 per trap net). Catch rates of bluegill in Lake Okabena have historically been highly variable (0.1 per trap net in 1990 to 12.7 per trap net in 2000), and have averaged 2.8 per trap net since 1982. Bluegills ranged in length from 6.8 to 8.0 inches and averaged 7.4 inches. A near shore survey done in 2010 captured nearly 5,000 YOY bluegills, suggesting that the bluegill population was on the upswing in Lake Okabena. It appears that while bluegills successfully reproduced in 2010, the YOY bluegills did not recruit to the population, as indicated by the poor catch rate in 2014. Recruitment of bluegills could be influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to predation, survival through the winter, food availability, etc. The characteristics of Lake Okabena do not favor bluegills, as water quality is poor and aquatic vegetation is scarce. Bluegills tend to do well in lakes that have clear water and abundant vegetation. While the effort to enhance Lake Okabena's bluegill population by using connected ponds as bluegill rearing ponds is aesthetically pleasing, it appears that it is having little effect on the population.  <br> 
 <br> 
YELLOW PERCH <br> 
Historical catch rates of yellow perch have ranged from 9.7 per gill net in 1986 to 116.7 per gill net in 2006. In 2014, yellow perch were captured at a rate of 23.0 per gill net, similar to the 2010 catch rate of 24.7 per gill net, and slightly greater than the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (3.0 to 22.5 per gill net). Yellow perch ranged in length from 6.1 to 9.9 inches and averaged 7.6 inches. Lake Okabena's yellow perch provide a good forage base for walleye, but do not provide much of an angling opportunity for fishermen.  <br> 
 <br> 
NORTHERN PIKE <br> 
Although not specifically managed for northern pike, Lake Okabena has maintained a low abundance pike population. The 2014 catch rate of northern pike was 1.3 per gill net, equal to the highest observed catch rate in Lake Okabena. Northern pike ranged in length from 17.6 to 25.0 inches and averaged 22.3 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
FRESHWATER DRUM <br> 
Freshwater drum are relatively new to Lake Okabena, as they were first sampled there in 2010 (N=1 in trap net). Since, the freshwater drum have taken off, and were captured at a rate of 23.0 per gill net in 2014, which is near the upper end of expected catch rates for similar lakes (24.2 per gill net). Two freshwater drum, 14.0 to 16.0 inches in length were captured, likely representing fish from the original introduction of this species. The rest of the sampled freshwater drum ranged from 9.0 to 10.5 inches (probably one year class), indicating that the original introduced fish successfully reproduced in Lake Okabena. Young-of-the-year freshwater drum can provide an additional prey resource for walleyes and other large predators when they are small; however, they can also compete with the more desirable species of fish (walleye, northern pike, yellow perch, black crappie, white crappie) for habitat and prey resources. Freshwater drum could have potentially entered Lake Okabena through the diversion prior to 2010. That diversion was closed in 2012 in an effort to prevent the movement of invasive carp.  The introduction may also have been unintentional via a bait bucket. To avoid unintended introductions, anglers should be diligent about disposing of unused bait in the trash, and should report unpermitted movement of fish. <br> 
 <br> 
OTHER SPECIES <br> 
Common carp were captured at a rate of 16.0 per trap net, which is the second highest catch rate of carp on Lake Okabena. The majority (94 percent) of common carp were between 10.0 and 15.0 inches, indicative of one strong year class accounting for most of the population.  <br> 
Bigmouth buffalo abundance in 2014 was the highest recorded in survey history on Lake Okabena (22.7 per gill net, 11.5 per trap net). Bigmouth buffalo sampled in gill nets and trap nets ranged in length from 7.6 to 11.0 inches, likely representing a single year-class. <br> 
 <br> 
Black bullhead abundance continued to be low (1.3 per trap net), likely a result of predation by channel catfish. Other species of fish sampled included white sucker, golden shiner, and pumpkinseed. <br> 
 <br> 
Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> 
 <br> 
Best management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake. High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality. Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br>

 Survey Date = '2002-06-17',  County Name = 'Olmsted', Lake Name = 'Willow Reservoir 4' 
 Lake Clarity = '' 
 Narrative = '<p>Willow Reservoir 4 is a 39 acre impoundment located just east of Hwy 63 and south of Hwy 52, in southern Rochester.  Access is allowed by the City of Rochester through the Gamehaven Boy Scout Camp located off Olmsted County Road 1, on the east side of the pond.  The pond was constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as part of the Rochester Flood Control Project.  State DNR Fisheries stocked the impoundment with a variety of gamefish including bluegill, black crappie, large and smallmouth bass, channel catfish, yellow bullhead and yellow perch.  As an impoundment on Willow Creek, nutrients from upstream sources are trapped, resulting in heavy algal blooms during the summer months.  Currently, WR4 provides a decent summer and winter fishery for bluegill, black crappie and an occassional largemouth bass.Trapnetting during the 2002 assessment collected bluegill and black crappie at rates of 48.4 and 6.8/net, considered high or above average for lakes similar in type.  Average length measured for bluegill and black crappie was 6.4 and 7.8 inches, respectively.Electrofishing to assess the largemouth bass population was completed in the fall of 2002.  Bass were collected at a rate of 46/hour, and only averaged about 8.8 inches.  However, there were some large fish sampled as well, including three between 18 and 20 inches.Willow Reservoir 4 is a bass/panfish pond with moderate to poor water quality.  The public access is about a 1 mile-long walk through woods on the east side of the pond.  The City of Rochester is responsible for the current condition of the access. If you're willing to make the walk in, decent fishing for bluegill and black crappie can be found.    </p>'

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/10/2015 Clarity: 3.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>     Adley Lake is a shallow 239-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in southeastern Otter Tail County. The city of Parkers Prairie abuts the north shoreline of the lake. The maximum depth of the lake is 20 feet but the majority of the lake is less than 10 feet in depth.  Consequently, the lake is subject to periodic winterkill.  The Parkers Prairie Sportsmen's Club operates an aeration system during severe winters, which has recently minimized the severity of winterkills.  The secchi disk reading was 3.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 1.5 to 4.2 feet.  Water clarity can be affected by seasonal algae and plankton blooms.   <br> 
     Residential development is minimal but has been increasing recently.  A public water access is located in a city park along the east shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of gravel and sand.  Hardstem bulrush and cattails are located in several areas around the lake; however, they are most prevalent in the southern basin.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They provide critical spawning and nursery habitat for species of fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and sunfish.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can actually absorb and break down pollutants.  Because of their ecological importance, bulrush and cattails may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> 
     Adley Lake is a popular fishing lake, especially for anglers in southeastern Otter Tail County where the number of lakes is limited.  Historically, fish abundance has fluctuated due to periodic winterkill.  The dominant gamefish species are Northern Pike, Walleye, Bluegill, and Black Crappie. <br> 
     Walleyes ranged in length from 10.0 to 20.2 inches with an average length and weight of 15.4 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 13.1 inches at three years of age. <br> 
      Northern Pike ranged in length from 16.0 to 33.3 inches with an average length and weight of 22.8 inches and 2.7 pounds.  Age data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good.   Pike attain an average length of 24.1 inches at four years of age. <br> 
     Black Crappies have remained consistently abundant over the recent series of surveys.  Twenty-one percent of the crappies were 9.0 inches or greater in length.   Age data indicate that the 2013 year class is strong and should provide good angling for several years.   <br> 
     Bluegills have also remained consistently abundant.  Age data indicate that Bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Size structure is also good as 34% of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.9 inches at five years of age. <br> 
     Anglers can help maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br>

 Narrative = '<p>     Anna Lake is a 538-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in south-central Otter Tail County approximately four miles north of Underwood, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 55 feet; however, 69% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 7.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.0 to 9.3 feet.   <br> 
     The majority of the shoreline of Anna Lake remains undeveloped.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located along the southwest shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Hardstem bulrush and common cattail are prevalent along the shoreline of the entire lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> 
     Anna Lake can be ecologically classified as a Bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant game-fish species.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available. <br> 
     A spring electrofishing assessment was conducted to analyze the Largemouth Bass population.  Data indicate that Largemouth Bass are abundant and that the population is well balanced.  Bass ranged in length from 4.6 to 16.0 inches with an average length of 11.1 inches.  Bass attain an average length of 14.3 inches at five years of age. <br> 
     Data collected from a spring trapnetting assessment indicate that Black Crappies are very abundant.  The 2009 and 2010 year classes are strong and should provide consistently good Black Crappie angling for several years.  Sixty-six percent of the crappies sampled were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 11.1 inches at five years of age. <br> 
     Bluegill abundance tends to fluctuate due to inconsistent levels of reproduction. Twenty-two percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.3 inches at five years of age.  <br> 
     Walleye abundance is at a historical high for this lake.  Walleyes ranged in length from 10.3 to 21.9 inches with an average length and weight of 14.5 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.5 inches at four years of age. <br> 
     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.      <br>

 Narrative = '<p>    Annie Battle Lake is a 334-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located approximately five miles northeast of the town of Battle Lake, MN.  An unnavigable inlet from Molly Stark Lake is located along the southwest shoreline.  An unnavigable outlet along the northwest shoreline flows into Blanche Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed of rolling grasslands interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 51 feet; however, 45% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The shoreline length is 2.7 miles.  The secchi disk reading was 10.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 8.5 to 14.5 feet.  <br> 
     The entire shoreline of Annie Battle Lake is located within Glendalough State Park; therefore, development along the lakeshore is very limited.  There is a campground located on the northwest shoreline with four rental cabins and several campsites.  Primitive camping sites are also located along the east shoreline.  A carry-in water access is also located along the northwest shoreline.     <br> 
     Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Hardstem bulrush is prevalent along the entire shoreline.  Emergent aquatic plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and help absorb excess nutrients.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit.   <br> 
     Prior to 1990, there was no public access to Annie Battle Lake.  When Glendalough State Park was established in 1990 and public access was allowed to the lake, angling pressure was extensive, which negatively impacted the quality fishery that existed.  In an attempt to re-establish the quality of the fish populations, Annie Battle Lake was closed to angling from 1993 to 1997.  In 1997, special regulations were implemented which designated the lake as a "heritage fishery" in which electronic equipment (depth finders, GPS units, etc.) and motors of any type, including power augers, were prohibited.  The regulation also includes catch and release angling for Largemouth Bass and Northern Pike and a reduced bag limit for Bluegill and Black Crappie (5 each per day).  The intent of this regulation is to improve and maintain the size structure of these species. <br> 
     Annie Battle Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Largemouth bass, and Bluegill are the dominant fish species in Annie Battle Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.   <br> 
     Northern Pike are moderately abundant.  Age data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 13.9 to 28.4 inches with an average length and weight of 19.2 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 20.1 inches at four years of age. <br> 
 The Bluegill population is also moderately abundant.  Bluegill size structure is excellent with 40% of the sample measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.5 inches at six years of age.  The reduced bag limit may be having a positive influence on the size structure of the Bluegill population.      <br> 
    Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced Largemouth Bass population exists.  Age data indicate that Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 5.5 to 16.7 inches with an average length and weight of 11.7 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Largemouth Bass attain an average length of 13.1 inches at five years of age.   <br>

The secchi disk reading was 18.0 feet.  Previous secchi diskreadings have ranged from 3.0 to 16.5 feet.  <br> 
     A city owned public access is located along the east shoreline of the lake.  There has been a considerable increase in development in recent years and the only remaining undeveloped shoreline is the western portion of the south shore.  Shoalwater substrates consist primarily of rubble and muck.  Hardstem bulrush is limited to the areas around the points on the south shore and common cattail is abundant in the west end of the lake.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit. <br> 
     Bass Lake is subject to low dissolved oxygen levels in the winter and periodic winterkill occasionally occurs.  A creamery was operated for many years on the east shore, which discharged effluent directly into the lake.  This created high phosphorous levels in the lake and even though the creamery has been closed for many years, the phosphorous will remain in the system for a long time.  As a result, the lake is still subject to dramatic algae blooms in the summer, which limit recreational activity. <br> 
     Bass Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie are the dominant gamefish species.  Suitable spawning habitat for these species exists throughout the lake. <br> 
     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that an excellent Largemouth bass population exists. Largemouth bass ranged in length from 4.8 to 18.7 inches with a mean length and weight of 13.4 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Bass reproduction appears to be consistently good.  Bass attain an average length of 14.9 inches at five years of age. <br> 
     Bluegills are very abundant and their size structure is also very good.  Eighty-four percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegill growth rates are also very good with an average length of 8.1 inches at four years of age.  <br> 
     Black Crappie abundance is at a historical high.  The 2010 year class is strong and should provide good crappie angling for several years.  Crappies ranged in length from 8.8 to 10.6 inches with an average length of 9.5 inches.  Crappies attain an average length of 9.6 inches at four years of age.     <br>

There are no inlets or outlets located on Beers Lake.  Water levels are approximately 6 to 8 feet above normal levels.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located along the southwest shoreline of the lakes.  Since the access is located within the state park a state park sticker is required.  Beers Lake is part of the Otter Tail River watershed and the immediate watershed is composed of hardwood forest.  Beers Lake has a maximum depth of 61 feet; 49% of the surface acreage is less than 15 feet deep.  The secchi disk reading, a measurement of water clarity, was 14.2 feet.  Past secchi disk readings have ranged from 11.3 to 17.0 feet.  Beers Lake is included in lake class 25 of the MNDNR lake classification scheme.  Other lakes in the Fergus Falls management area that are in lake class 25 include:  Bass (Elbow), Franklin, Jolly Ann, Leek, South Lida, Long, Red River, Schwartz, Sewell, West Silent, East Spirit, Stuart, Swan, Sybil, and West Olaf. <br> 
     The majority of the shoreline is undeveloped.  Shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand scattered with gravel and rubble with some muck mixed in.  Stands of hardstem bulrush are scattered along the entire lakeshore.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.

     Northern pike abundance is low, while the size structure could be considered average, as 33% of the northern pike sampled by gill nets were 24-inches or greater.  Age data from recent surveys indicate that pike recruitment is consistent.  The average length and weight of northern pike sampled by gill nets was 24.0 inches and 3.3 pounds.  Northern pike attain a mean length of 18.7 inches at age-III. <br> 
     Bluegill abundance is considered to be within the normal range for lakes of this type, however the size structure is poor.  There were no bluegills sampled by trap nets 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Recruitment appears to be consistent as there were five consecutive year classes sampled.  Bluegill attain a mean length of 5.1 inches at age-V. <br> 
     A spring electrofishing assessment was conducted to analyze the largemouth bass population.  Largemouth sampled during the electrofishing assessment ranged in length from 4.5 to 17.1 inches with an average length and weight of 10.9 inches and 0.8 pounds.  Age and growth data indicated that the largemouth bass population in Beers Lake has moderate levels of recruitment, mortality, and growth.  Bass attain a mean length of 11.4 inches at age-IV.   <br> 
     Black crappie abundance is considered to be within the normal range for lakes of this type.  Black crappie sampled ranged in length from 5.2 to 11.0 inches with a mean length of 8.2 inches.  Eighteen percent of the trap net sample was at least 10 inches or greater.  Age data indicates that recruitment is consistent, as seven year consecutive year classes year sampled.  Black crappie attain a mean length of 7.4 inches at age-IV. <br> 
     A spring trap netting assessment was conducted to analyze the muskellunge population.  A total of twenty-six muskellunge were sampled, ranging in length from 19.5 to 46.0 inches.  Thirty five percent the muskellunge were 40.0 inches or greater in length.  Age data indicates that the muskellunge population is being sustained by stocking, as the strongest year classes correspond to years of stocking.  The DNR stocks 200 muskellunge fingerlings on a biennial basis.  Muskellunge attain a mean length of 41.0 inches at age-X. <br> 
     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.

Belmont Lake is located within the DNR's Fergus Falls Management Area.     The majority of the shoreline of Belmont Lake is undeveloped.  The 1991 resurvey identified 23 homes/cottages on the lake.  There is no designated public access on the lake but access may be gained to the lake for a fee at various locations.  The shoal water substrates consist of sand, gravel, and rubble.  The substrate in the bay areas is predominately muck.  Several stands of hardstem bulrush are scattered along various shorelines of the lakes.  Common cattail is prevalent in three of the bays.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling within this lake it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.     Belmont Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie are the dominant gamefish species in the lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.     A high-density northern pike population exists.  The catch rate has exceeded the upper limit of the normal range for lake class 33 in all fish surveys to date.  Age data indicate that pike natural reproduction is consistently good.  Northern pike ranged in size from 12.6 to 30.5 inches with an average length and weight of 18.4 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Pike reach an average length of 17.3 inches at five years of age.  Growth rate estimates are slower than average pike growth rates for class 33 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.  The slow growth rate of pike may be attributed to their high recruitment rates and low abundance of yellow perch, a preferred forage fish.     The bluegill test-net catch rate was lower than the two previous lake surveys but was still above the normal range for class 33 lakes.  Recruitment appears to be consistent with strong year classes produced from 1992 through 1994.  Twenty percent of the bluegills in the trap net sample were 7.0 inches or greater in length; however, very few fish in the sample exceeded 8.0 inches in length.  Bluegills attain a mean length of 5.2 inches at eight years of age, which is below the statewide normal range of growth for class 33 lakes.     The largemouth bass population cannot be fully analyzed from this survey since a spring electrofishing sample was not completed.  Bass are less susceptible to capture with gill nets or trap nets so numbers in the sample were limited.  Based on the fish sampled, the population appears to be within the normal range for lake class 33.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 8.0 to 18.0 inches.  Growth rate estimates for bass are within the normal range for class 33 lakes.     Catch data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicated that black crappie are abundant in Belmont Lake.  Crappies ranged in length from 5.0 to 13.3 inches with and average length of 7.7 inches and 0.3 pounds.  Thirty-eight percent of the crappies were 9.0 inches or greater in length.  Age data indicate that black crappie recruitment is consistent with strong year classes produced in 1995, 1996 and 1997.  Black crappie growth rate estimates are similar to mean crappie growth rates for class 33 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area with a mean length of 8.9 inches at five years of age.     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Belmont Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.</p>'

     Big Pine Lake is a popular angling lake.  The lake has a reputation as one of the premier walleye angling lakes in Otter Tail County.  Black crappie, northern pike, and yellow perch are also abundant. The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.   <br> 
     Walleye is a primary management specie in Big Pine Lake.  Walleye abundance has historically been high in Big Pine Lake.   Walleyes ranged in length from 6.8 to 25.5 inches with an average length and weight of 13.1 inches and 0.9 pounds.  Age and catch data indicate that the 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010 year classes are strong.  These strong year classes should provide excellent walleye angling for several years.  Age and catch data from recent lake surveys indicate that walleye natural reproduction and recruitment is substantial enough to consistently sustain the walleye population at or above DNR long range management goals. Walleyes attain an average length of 14.7 inches at four years of age.   <br> 
     An experimental walleye regulation was implemented on May 10, 2003.  The regulation is an 18.0 to 26.0 protected slot limit with one walleye over 26.0 inches allowed in possession.  The intent of this regulation is to improve the size structure of the walleye population in Big Pine Lake.  The regulation will be in effect for ten years during which time its effectiveness will be evaluated.  <br> 
     Northern pike population characteristics have demonstrated stability over the recent series of lake surveys.  The pike population has remained at a moderate density and natural reproduction has continued to be consistently good.  Northern pike ranged in length from 12.9 to 34.6 inches with an average length and weight of 21.1 inches and 2.3 pounds. Pike exhibit fast growth rates with an average length of 25.8 inches at four years of age.   <br> 
     Historical catch and length data indicate that yellow perch size structure fluctuates.  Eighteen percent of the perch in this assessment were 8.0 inches or greater in length. <br>

The secchi disk reading during the 2012 lake survey was 11.2 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 3.1 to 8.1 feet.       <br> 
    The majority of the shoreline is undeveloped.  A DNR owned public access is located along the west shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand, gravel, and rubble.  Hardstem bulrush is prevalent along shoreline areas and on a mid-lake hump.  Emergent aquatic macrophytes such as bulrush provide important fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from erosion and can actually absorb and breakdown polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning habitat for fish species like northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> 
     Walleye is a primary management specie for this lake.  Walleyes ranged in length from 7.5 to 28.6 inches with an average length and weight of 15.8 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Age data indicate that the 2010 year class is strong and should provide consistently good walleye angling for several years.  Walleyes attain an average length of 16.4 inches at four years of age. <br> 
    Northern pike abundance and size structure has historically fluctuated.  Pike ranged in length from 15.8 to 34.5 inches with an average length and weight of 22.6 inches and 2.5 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 24.7 inches at four years of age. <br> 
     Bluegill abundance and size structure has also fluctuated.  Only four percent of the bluegill sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.0 inches at three years of age. <br> 
        Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with an opportunity to catch more large fish in the future. <br>

The secchi disk reading was 15.2 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 9.3 to 16.0 feet.   <br> 
     The majority of the shoreline of Clitherall Lake has been extensively developed.  The development consists primarily of homes, cabins and resorts.  A DNR owned public water access is located along the south shoreline and a township owned access is located along the north shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Stands of hardstem bulrush are scattered along the north and west shorelines.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> 
     Clitherall Lake can be ecologically classified as a Bass-Panfish-Walleye type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass, Walleye, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species. <br> 
     The long term trend has been a decline in Walleye abundance.  Walleyes ranged in length from 10.0 to 21.7 inches with an average length and weight of 15.9 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 15.2 inches at four years of age. <br>

     Bluegills are also very abundant.  Twenty-two percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.2 inches at seven years of age. <br> 
     A high density Largemouth Bass population exists.  Age and length data indicate that Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 6.7 to 15.4 inches with an average length and weight of 11.0 inches and 0.8 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 12.4 inches at five years of age. <br> 
     A Smallmouth Bass re-introduction plan was initiated in 1998.  In 1998 and 1999, a total of 433 Smallmouth Bass were stocked into Clitherall Lake.  In 1998, a no harvest regulation for Smallmouth Bass was implemented in order to protect Smallmouth Bass while a self-sustaining population was established. One hundred Smallmouth Bass half-log nesting structures were also placed into Clitherall Lake in 1998 and ten more were added in 1999.  These structures increased the available spawning habitat and increased spawning success.  Six off shore rock reefs were constructed in 1999 to provide juvenile Smallmouth Bass feeding and escape cover.  SCUBA assessments in 1999 indicated use of the half logs by spawning Smallmouth Bass; active nests and fry were also observed.  Juvenile and young of the year Smallmouth Bass were observed utilizing the off shore reef habitat.  In 2015, the no harvest regulation was amended to a 14.0 to 20.0 inch protected slot length limit with one over 20.0 inches allowed in possession.  <br> 
        In 2014, a spring electrofishing assessment was conducted to analyze the Smallmouth Bass population.  Data indicated that a moderate density population with a good size structure exists.  Smallmouth Bass ranged in length from 7.4 to 19.9 inches with an average length and weight of 14.4 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Smallmouth Bass attain an average length of 14.0 inches at four years of age. <br>

     The walleye test-net catch rate was within the normal range for this class of lake.  Walleye ranged in length from 8.1 to 31.1 inches with a mean length and weight of 17.7 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Walleye attain an average length of 15.5 inches at four years of age. <br> 
     Anglers can help maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.      <br>

 Narrative = '<p>     East Leaf Lake is a 404-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in eastern Otter Tail County approximately five miles north of Henning, MN.  East Leaf Lake is connected to Middle Leaf Lake by an unnavigable culvert.  The Leaf River outlet is located along the north shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  East Leaf Lake has a maximum depth of 47 feet; however, 28% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2010 survey was 5.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 3.8 to 8.0 feet.   <br> 
     Development is located along the east and west shorelines and some dwellings are scattered along the north shoreline.  The 1994 lake resurvey report referenced 26 home/cabins along the shoreline.  One resort is located along the northwest shoreline.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located along the east shoreline. Shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel. Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, wild rice, and cattails) is prevalent along the entire shoreline of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> 
     East Leaf Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant species in the fish community.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.  <br> 
     The test-net catch rate for northern pike exceeded the expected range for this type of lake.  Northern pike size structure has historically remained poor.  In this assessment, only 3% of the pike were 24.0 inches or greater in length.  Northern pike growth is slow with an average length of 21.2 inches at five years of age. <br> 
     The black crappie population is very abundant.  Age data from recent surveys indicate that black crappie reproduction is inconsistent.  The 2005 year class is strong.  This strong year class should provide consistently good crappie fishing for several years.  Size structure is excellent with 64% of the crappies measuring 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Black crappies attain an average length of 9.8 inches at five years of age. <br> 
     Bluegill abundance tends to fluctuate; however, the test-net catch rate in this assessment was within the expected range.  Bluegill size structure is very good with 66% of the bluegills measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.2 inches at six years of age.  <br> 
     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.      <br>

The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  East Lost Lake has a maximum depth of 36 feet; however, 65% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 8.3 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.2 to 10.5 feet.   <br> 
     A majority of the shoreline is developed with homes and cabins.  An unimproved, carry-in DNR public access is located on the west shoreline.  Boat access can be obtained through the DNR public access located on adjacent Deer Lake.  Stands of hardstem bulrush, wild rice, and common cattail are located at various locations around the lake.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and help absorb excess nutrients.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit.   <br> 
     A moderate density Northern Pike population exists.  Age and length data from recent surveys indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 11.2 to 27.3 inches with an average length and weight of 18.3 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 18.3 inches at four years of age. <br>

The secchi disk reading was 12.6 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 12.5 22.0 feet. <br> 
    The east shoreline of East Silent Lake has been extensively developed.  Development is also scattered along the north and south shorelines.  Homes, cabins, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  A county owned public water access is located off of County Road 41 along the west shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Emergent aquatic macrophytes such as hardstem bulrush or common cattail are extremely rare. <br> 
     East Silent Lake is a popular Walleye angling lake.  Walleye is a primary management specie and data from recent lake surveys indicate that they are abundant.  Walleyes ranged in length from 9.2 to 25.0 inches with an average length and weight of 15.9 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Walleye growth is fast as they attain an average length of 15.3 inches at four years of age. <br> 
     A low-density Northern Pike population exists due to a lack of suitable spawning habitat.  Pike ranged in length from 16.7 to 30.8 inches with an average length and weight of 22.2 inches and 2.6 pounds.  Northern Pike grow fast with an average length of 23.1 inches at four years of age.        <br>

 Narrative = '<p>   East Spirit Lake is a 544 acre, moderately fertile lake located in north-central Otter Tail County, approximately three miles southwest of Vergas, MN.  The maximum depth is 38 feet and 45% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during this survey was 13.5 feet, which indicates good water clarity.  Secchi disk readings since 1975 have ranged from 11.0 - 15.0 feet.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of gravel, sand and muck.  The majority of the north and south shorelines are developed.  A state owned public access is located on County Road 4 along the NW shore of the lake.   <br> 
     Along with the many shoreline points that contain bulrush, there are 2 distinct bulrush humps on the northern main portion of the lake.  Another unique area is the eastern bay located on the central portion of the lake that is rimmed with a floating cattail bog.  Common cattail and hardstem bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  These emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can actually absorb and break down pollutants.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit.  <br> 
    East Spirit Lake can be ecologically classified as a Bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species present.   <br> 
   Walleye is a primary management specie in this lake.  Walleye abundance was low in 2013 (1.1 per net). Walleye from gill nets ranged in length from 11.7 - 22.1 inches, with an average length and weight of 18.2 inches and 2.2 pounds. Walleye attain an average length of 14.7 inches at four years of age.    <br> 
     Northern Pike abundance has remained at a moderate density and age data indicates that natural reproduction has continued to be consistently good.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 13.9 - 34.3 inches with an average length and weight of 18.7 inches and 1.5 pounds.   Eleven percent of the Northern Pike in the gill net sample measured greater than 24.0 inches in length.  Pike growth is slow with an average length of 19.7 inches at four years of age.  The slow growth rates for pike may be attributed to the low abundance of Yellow Perch, a preferred forage fish. <br> 
    Bluegill abundance has historically fluctuated and is now on the high end.  Fifty-six percent of the Bluegill sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 5.4 inches at five years of age. <br> 
    The Black Crappie population appears to be rebounding.  Black Crappies ranged in length from 5.8 - 11.6 inches with an average length of 9.3 inches.  Black Crappies attain an average length of 9.3 inches at five years of age. <br> 
   Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced Largemouth Bass population exists.  Age data indicate that Bass reproduction is consistently good.

Main lake shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  The substrate in the north bay is predominantly muck.  The secchi disk reading, a measure of water clarity, was 16.0 feet in 2005.  Readings in previous surveys have ranged from 15.0 to 24.0 feet.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located on the northwest shoreline.  Elbow Lake is included in class 28 of the MN DNR lake classification scheme.     Moderate development exists around the lake.  Emergent vegetation (bulrush, cattails, and wild rice) exists in various areas throughout the lake.  Emergent plants are important because they provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can even absorb and breakdown pollutants from the water.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also are important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.     Elbow Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Elbow Lake contains good populations of northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill.       The northern pike population has remained at a moderate density in all of the surveys conducted.  Pike are of good average size with 56% of the fish > 24 inches in length.  Pike ranged in length from 13.9 to 31.2 inches with an average length and weight of 24.2 inches and 3.4 pounds.     The black crappie catch rate has increased from previous surveys. Crappies ranged in length from 5.4 to 12.6 inches with an average length and weight of 9.1 inches and 0.5 pounds.  Sixty-four percent of the crappies were at least 9.0 inches in length.  The 2001 year class appears to be strong and should provide consistently good crappie fishing for several years.       The bluegill catch rate is down from previous surveys but is within the normal range for lake class 28.  The number of fish 7.0 inches or greater in length has increased from previous surveys.  Twenty-nine percent of the bluegills were at least 7.0 inches in length.       A spring electrofishing assessment in 2005 documented a high abundance of largemouth bass.  Bass ranged in length from 4.1 to 16.6 inches with an average length and weight of 10.7 and 0.8 pounds.  Age data indicate that bass reproduction is consistently good.  This is an indication that there is good largemouth bass spawning habitat present in the lake.      The walleye population remains fairly stable and the catch rate is equivalent to the upper limit of the normal range for lake class 28.  Walleye ranged in length from 15.8 to 29.0 inches with an average length and weight of 21.2 inches and 2.9 pounds. The strongest year classes have corresponded to years when walleye fingerlings and/or yearlings were stocked.  Beginning in 2006, the walleye fingerling stocking rate will be doubled.

 Narrative = '<p>     Ellingson Lake is a 138-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in southeastern Otter Tail County approximately three miles southeast of Clitherall, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  A non-navigable outlet is located along the southeast shoreline.  The maximum depth is 19 feet; however, 71% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2006 lake survey was 4.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 3.0 to 3.5 feet.  The MN DNR has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics.  Ellingson Lake is included in lake class 34; other area lakes in this same classification include Block, Deer, Round, Tonseth, and Walker.
     Shoreline development around the lake is minimal.  Two houses were counted during the 2000 lake survey.  A DNR owned public water access is located along the southeast shoreline. Emergent vegetation (hardstem bulrush, common cattail, and wild rice) is prevalent throughout the lake.  Emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  
     Ellingson Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species.  These species are prolific because of the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available. 
     Northern pike abundance increased slightly from the 2000 survey but the size structure decreased.  Only 8% of the northern pike were 24.0 inches or greater iin length.  Pike ranged in length from 14.8 to 29.1 inches with a mean length and weight of 20.4 inches and 1.9 pounds.
     Bluegill abundance has increased dramatically and has reached a historical high.  Size structure is also very good.  Forty-two percent of the bluegills in the trap net sample were at least 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegills in the trap net sample ranged in length from 3.7 to 9.3 inches.
     A spring trap net assessment for black crappies yielded a CPUE of 5.1 per net.  Black crappies ranged in length from 3.6 to 10.9 inches with a mean length of 8.1 inches.  PSD and RSD-P values were 80 and 4, respectively.
     A spring electrofishing assessment for largemouth bass yielded a CPUE of 30.1 fish per hour.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 4.4 to 13.9 inches with a mean length of 7.6 inches, whereas largemouth sampled during the spring trap net assessment ranged in length from 10.5 to 17.9 inches with a mean length of 15.6 inches.
     The walleye abundance in Ellingson Lake is considered low but the quality of the walleyes that are present is very good.  Walleyes ranged in length from 22.8 to 29.5 inches with a mean length and weight of 26.9 inches and 6.7 pounds.  Walleye fry stocking appears to be supplementing limited natural reproduction.  Walleye management includes triennial walleye fry stocking.

     The majority of the shoreline on Fish Lake remains undeveloped.  The development that exists (homes and cabins) is located primarily along the north shoreline.  The undeveloped shoreline is composed of mixed hardwoods.  A DNR owned public water access is located along the north shoreline off of County Road 1.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and silt.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are scattered along various shorelines of the lake.  Common cattails are also prevalent along several areas of shoreline.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> 
     Fish Lake is a popular angling lake because of its proximity to Fergus Falls.  Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth bass, Black crappie, and Bluegill are the most sought after game-fish species in Fish Lake. <br> 
     Walleye is a primary management specie in this lake.  Walleyes ranged in length from 11.0 to 26.0 inches with an average length and weight of 14.7 inches and 1.2 pounds.  The 2012 year class is very strong and should provide good Walleye angling for several years.  Walleyes exhibit fast growth with an average length of 14.4 inches at four years of age.   <br> 
     Northern Pike abundance and size structure has historically fluctuated.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 14.3 to 24.6 inches with average length and weight of 20.2 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 21.7 inches at four years of age. <br> 
     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicates that a balanced Largemouth Bass population exists.  Bass reproduction appears to be consistently good.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 6.6 to 18.9 inches with an average length and weight of 11.7 inches and 1.0 pound.  Bass attain an average length of 12.9 inches at four years of age. <br> 
     Data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicates that Black Crappies are very abundant.  The 2010 and 2011 year classes appear to be very strong and should provide good crappie angling for several years.  Seventy-two percent of the crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Black crappies attain an average length of 10.9 inches at five years of age. <br> 
     Anglers can help maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.</p>'

The maximum depth of Fogard Lake is 42 feet; however, 68% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the survey was 11.5 feet, indicating excellent water clarity.  Periodic plankton/algae blooms during the summer months can influence secchi disk readings.  At the time of the assessment, water levels were extremely high so the previous benchmarks could not be located.  Two new benchmarks were established.  Fogard Lake is included in lake class 28 of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) lake classification scheme.     The entire shoreline of Fogard Lake is privately owned and  very little shoreline development exists.  The light development consists of three houses with docks and one seasonal cabin.  The access is a privately owned earthen access which is located along the west shoreline of the lake.  Fogard Lake has a prevalent wild rice fringe.  Common cattail are also abundant along the shoreline.  Emergent aquatic plants such as wild rice and common cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  Submergent vegetation is prevalent along the south and west shorelines.     Since the access is privately owned and public access is restricted, Fogard Lake receives little fishing pressure.  Fogard Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Black crappie, bluegill, brown bullhead, largemouth bass, northern pike, and pumpkinseed sunfish are the dominant fish species in Fogard Lake.  Fogard Lake also had a high catch rate of hydrid sunfish, which commonly occurs in lakes with over abundant areas of submergent vegetation.  Growth of gamefish species may be limited by a low abundance of yellow perch, a preferred forage fish.     A moderate-density northern pike population exists.  The northern pike test-net catch rate was within the normal range for class 28 lakes.  Age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistent.  Northern pike size structure is poor; pike ranged in length from 17.6 to 21.5 inches with an average length and weight of 19.9 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Growth rate estimates were slow.  Pike attain an average length of 18.2 inches at four years of age.      A high-density slow growing largemouth bass population appears to exist.  The largemouth bass test-net catch rate exceeded the normal range for class 28 lakes.  Age data indicate that largemouth bass reproduction may be inconsistent.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 4.5 to 17.3 inches with an average length and weight of 8.3 inches and 0.5 pounds.  Growth rate estimates are extremely slow; bass attain a mean length of 9.6 inches at five years of age.         The black crappie test-net catch rate was within the normal range for class 28 lakes.  Age data indicate that crappie reproduction is consistently good.  Crappies ranged in length from 3.2 to 11.1 inches with an average length and weight of 7.6 inches and 0.3 pounds.  Sixty percent of the black crappies sampled were at least 8.0 inches in length.  Black crappie growth is moderate with a mean length of 8.0 inches at four years of age.

     The bluegill population has an excellent size structure.  Seventy-three percent of the bluegill sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.3 inches at five years of age. <br> 
     Data from an electrofishing assessment in 2005 indicated that a balanced largemouth bass population with consistently good reproduction exists in Hoffman Lake.  <br> 
     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium and large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br>

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/01/2016 Clarity: 7.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>    Hoot Lake is a 155-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in southwest Otter Tail County and is within the city limits of Fergus Falls, MN.  Hoot Lake is part of the Otter Tail River chain of lakes.  The river enters the lake along the northeast shoreline and outlets to Wright Lake along the south shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of residential areas except for a small area north of the lake which is composed of mixed hardwoods and pasture.  The maximum depth is 20 feet; however, 41% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 7.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 8.5 to 11.0 feet. <br> 
     The majority of the shoreline of Hoot Lake is developed with homes.  A city owned public water access is located along the south shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand, gravel, and rubble.  Hardstem bulrush and wild rice are prevalent around the entire shoreline of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and wild rice provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> 
     Hoot Lake can be ecologically classified as a Bass-Panfish-Walleye type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Walleye, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat within the lake and the river connected to it. <br> 
     Age and length data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistenty good.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 19.4 to 28.8 inches with an average length and weight of 22.8 inches and 2.5 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 22.7 inches at four years of age. <br> 
     Catch data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that Smallmouth Bass are very abundant.  Age data indicate that Smallmouth Bass reproduction is consistently good. Smallmouth Bass ranged in length from 5.9 to 18.7 inches with an average length and weight of 13.9 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Smallmouth Bass attain an average length of 14.6 inches at four years of age.  There is a catch and release regulation for Smallmouth Bass on the Otter Tail River and its impoundments which includes Hoot Lake.   <br> 
     Walleye abundance remains moderately high.  Walleyes ranged in length from 7.2 to 25.2 inches with an average length and weight of 14.6 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 16.1 inches at four years of age. <br> 
     Bluegill abundance remains high; however, size structure is poor.  Onlly six percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.8 inches at five years of age. <br> 
    Two Lake Sturgeon were sampled. Lake Sturgeon were initially sampled in the 2006 assessment. Lake Sturgeon enter Hoot Lake by downstream movement from Otter Tail Lake where a Lake Sturgeon re-introduction plan was implemented in 2002. <br> 
     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Hoot Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br>

 Narrative = '<p>     Jewett Lake is a 737-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in west-central Otter Tail County approximately eight miles north of Fergus Falls, MN.  Jewett Lake is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed; however, there are no inlets or outlets connected to the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Jewett Lake is 75 feet; however, 36% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2014 lake survey was 6.2 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 7.1 to 14.4 feet.     <br> 
     The north and east shorelines of Jewett Lake have been extensively developed.  Homes and cottages compose the majority of the development.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located off of the township road along the north shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are located along the southwest and southeast shorelines.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.   <br> 
     A large area of hardstem bulrush and common cattail along the southwest shoreline is posted annually as a Largemouth Bass spawning area.  Restrictions imposed in this area prohibit fishing or motor boating from ice-out to June 30th, inclusive.  Suitable spawning habitat for Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and Black Crappie in Jewett Lake is primarily limited to this posted spawning area.   <br> 
     Jewett Lake is a popular angling lake during both the open water and ice fishing seasons.  Species most sought after include Walleye, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill.  Data from recent lake surveys indicate that these species are abundant and have good size distributions as well. <br> 
     Walleye is a primary management specie in this lake.  Walleyes ranged in length from 7.6 to 26.9 inches with an average length and weight of 16.1 inches and 1.7 pounds.  The 20012 year class appears to be strong and should provide good Walleye angling for several years.  Walleyes attain an average length of 15.6 inches at four years of age.    <br> 
     Jewett Lake is a popular lake for Largemouth Bass angling.  Data from recent electrofishing assessments indicate that an excellent Largemouth Bass population exists.  In the 2014 assessment, bass ranged in length from 10.9 to 18.5 inches with an average length and weight of 15.7 inches and 2.2 pounds.  Age data indicate that Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass attain an average length of 14.0 inches at five years of age.   <br> 
     Black Crappie abundance has remained stable in recent surveys.  Eighty-nine percent of the crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Black Crappies attain an average length of 9.3 inches at four years of age. <br> 
     Bluegill abundance and size structure has fluctuated in the recent series of surveys.  Age data indicate this is due to inconsistent reproduction which results in variable year class strength.  Twenty-two percent of the Bluegill trap net sample was 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.1 inches at six years of age. <br> 
     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.

The immediate watershed is composed primarily of mixed hardwoods.  Jim Lake has a maximum depth of 27 feet; however, 59% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 10.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 7.0 - 9.3 feet.   <br> 
     Little development exists around the lake.   A partially developed township owned public access is located on the northwest shoreline.  Sandy soils can at times make access difficult and parking is very limited.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and muck. Hardstem bulrush, cattails, and wild rice exist at several locations around the lake. These emergent aquatic plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish species such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass and Panfish.  They also are important nursery areas for all species of fish.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can actually absorb and break down pollutants.  Because of their ecological importance emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.   <br> 
     Jim Lake is subject to partial winterkills; however, none has been reported since the winter of 1986-1987.  Lack of winterkill has allowed the fish populations to expand. Jim Lake contains populations of Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Walleye, Black Crappie, Bluegill and Bullhead.   <br> 
  A high-density Northern Pike population exists that exceeds the normal range for lakes of this type.  The population increase is likely in response to high water levels and lack of winter kill in recent years.  Since 1994, Northern Pike abundance has been on a steady increase.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 15.6 to 35.8 inches with a mean length and weight of 20.2 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Only 4% of the pike exceeded 24.0 inches in length.  <br> 
     Only one Walleye was sampled.  This is the first time that the Walleye abundance hasn't exceeded the normal range.  Walleye abundance is likely limited by predation from the high-density Black Crappie population and Northern Pike populations. <br> 
     Black Crappie were sampled for the first time in 2000.  Black Crappie abundance has steadily increased and is now well above the normal range.  Age data indicate that Black Crappie reproduction is consistently good.  Twenty-three percent of the Black Crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Black Crappies attain an average length of 9.9 inches at five years of age.   <br> 
    Bluegill abundance increased from the previous survey but remains within the normal range.  The 2007 year class is strong as it composed a majority of the sample. Bluegill size structure continues to remain good as 76% of Bluegill 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.1 inches at five years of age.   <br> 
     Anglers can help maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br>

Land use in the immediate watershed is primarily agricultural.  The maximum depth of Johnson Lake is 32 feet; however, 49% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  Benchmark information indicated that the lake water level is presently higher than normal.  The secchi disk reading was 9.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 3.5 to 9.6 feet.  Periodic plankton-algae blooms throughout the summer months can decrease water clarity in this lake. <br> 
     The majority of the shoreline on Johnson Lake remains undeveloped.  The shoreline is primarily composed of agricultural and marsh land.  Several cabins are located along the northeast shoreline.  A public water access is also located along the northeast shoreline off of County Road 12.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are scattered along various shorelines of the lake and on several midlake sunken islands.  Common cattail is also prevalent in several bays and along several areas of shoreline.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.

The secchi disk reading during the 2012 survey was 6.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.0 to 14.0 feet.  Periodic plankton and algae blooms during the summer months can influence secchi disk readings.   <br> 
     The north shoreline of Long Lake has been extensively developed.  The development consists primarily of homes and cottages.  A DNR owned public access is also located along the north shoreline of the lake.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Hardstem bulrush stands are scattered around the entire lake.  Common cattail is prevalent along the east shoreline.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> 
     Long Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Largemouth bass, northern pike, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available. <br> 
     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that Long Lake has a high-density largemouth bass population.  Age data indicate that largemouth bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 3.2 to 19.0 inches with an average length and weight of 9.7 inches and 0.8 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 11.8 inches at four years of age. <br> 
     A moderate density northern pike population exists.  Northern pike also exhibit consistently good reproduction.  Pike size structure has historically been poor.  Pike ranged in length from 14.5 to 29.7 inches with an average length and weight of 18.9 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Northern pike growth is slow with an average length of 19.2 inches at four years of age.  Slow growth may be related to the low abundance of yellow perch, which is a preferred forage of northern pike. <br> 
     Bluegill reproduction has become more stable than it was historically; however, size structure has remained unchanged.  Eight percent of the bluegills were at least 7.0 inches in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.8 inches at seven years of age. <br> 
     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br>

These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> 
     Murphy Lake is a classic bass/panfish lake, where there is little to no natural walleye reproduction occurring.  Walleye fry stocked on three-year basis have supplemented natural reproduction to maintain the walleye population.  The mean length and weight of walleye sampled by gill nets in 2007 was 20.4 inches and 2.0 pounds.   <br> 
     At times Murphy Lake can provide some excellent bluegill fishing.  Bluegills are abundant and in past surveys showed good size structure.  Even though, only 23% of the bluegills sampled during the 2007 assessment were 7.0 inches or greater, the 2001 assessment had 66% of the bluegills seven inches or greater. <br> 
     The northern pike abundance has greatly increased while the size structure has slowly improved from past surveys.  Pike sampled by gill nets ranged in length from 14.7 to 31.9 inches with a mean length at capture of 20.7 inches.  Twelve percent of the northern pike sampled by gill nets were 24 inches or greater.  The increase in northern pike abundance appears to be impacting the yellow perch population, as there was only two yellow perch sampled by the gill nets.   <br> 
     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br>

North Lida Lake is connected to South Lida Lake by a navigable culvert under State Highway 108 along the south shoreline.  North Lida Lake is also connected to Lizzie Lake via a non-navigable culvert under County Road 4.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 58 feet; however, 43% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2015 lake survey was 14.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 6.0 to 9.5 feet.    <br> 
     A majority of the shoreline on North Lida Lake has been developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the development.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is located off of County Road 4 along the north shoreline.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are scattered throughout the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.

     North Lida Lake is one of the best all-around angling lakes in Otter Tail County.  Walleye, Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in the fish community.  Data from recent lake surveys indicate that these species are abundant and have good size distributions as well.   <br> 
     Walleyes ranged in length from 7.4 to 25.2 inches with an average length and weight of 14.3 inches and 1.0 pound.  Age and catch data indicate that the 2011 and 2012 year classes are very strong and should provide consistently good Walleye angling for several years.  Walleyes attain an average length of 13.7 inches at four years of age. <br> 
     Pike abundance has remained at a moderate density and natural reproduction has continued to be consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 11.4 to 31.6 inches with an average length and weight of 20.5 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 21.5 inches at four years of age. <br> 
     Age and catch data indicate that a balanced Smallmouth Bass population exists.  Smallmouth Bass ranged in length from 5.7 to 17.6 inches with an average length and weight of 12.1 inches and 1.1 pounds.  Age and length data indicate that reproduction is consistently good.  Smallmouth Bass attain an average length of 12.7 inches at four years of age. <br> 
     Data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicate that the Black Crappie population is very abundant and has a good size distribution.  Crappies ranged in length from 8.8 to 13.3 inches with an average length of 11.2 inches.  Forty-four percent of the crappies were 11.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 11.2 inches at five years of age. <br> 
     Age and catch data indicate that the Bluegill population is abundant and that reproduction is consistently good.  Twenty-six percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.0 inches at five years of age.   <br> 
     The DNR and the Lida Lakes Association have been involved in several cooperative projects designed to improve and protect water quality and fish habitat.  In 1998, a shoreline stabilization project was completed.  Rock rip-rap was used to stabilize several areas of shoreline that were experiencing varying degrees of erosion.  In 1997, 160 Smallmouth Bass nesting structures were constructed and placed in North Lida Lake.  These structures help Smallmouth Bass reproduce more successfully. <br> 
     Harvest regulations for Walleye and Black Crappie have been implemented on North Lida Lake.  The Walleye regulation is a 17.0 to 26.0 inch protected slot limit with one fish over 26.0 inches allowed in possession.  The Black Crappie regulation is an 11-inch minimum length limit.  The intent of these regulations is to improve the size structures of these populations. <br> 
     Anglers can also maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.

 Narrative = '<p>     North Turtle Lake is a 1,484-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County immediately northeast of Underwood, MN.  North Turtle Lake is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed.  There are no navigable inlets or outlets.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth is 19 feet; however, 98% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 5.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings ranged from 6.3 to 12.1 feet.  The water clarity of North Turtle Lake sometimes diminishes during the summer months due to plankton/algae blooms.   <br> 
     The majority of the shoreline of North Turtle Lake remains undeveloped.  A state owned public water access was developed along the north shoreline in 2011.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and muck.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are prevalent along the majority of the shoreline.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> 
     North Turtle Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available. <br> 
     A high-density Northern Pike population exists.  Age data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 15.9 to 30.4 inches with an average length and weight of 23.4 inches and 3.0 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 24.0 inches at four years of age. <br> 
      Seven percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Age data indicate that Bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.4 inches at five years of age. <br> 
     Data from a recent spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced Largemouth Bass population exists.  Bass reproduction is also consistently good.   Bass ranged in length from 4.8 to 19.5 inches with an average length and weight of 15.6 inches and 2.2 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 14.3 inches at five years of age. <br> 
     A spring trapnetting assessment was conducted to analyze the Black Crappie population.  A high-density Black Crappie population is present.   Age data indicate that reproduction is consistently good.   Thirty-five percent of the crappies were 10.0 incher or greater in length.  The 2013 year class is strong and should provide good crappie angling in the future.  Black Crappies attain an average length of 11.2 inches at five years of age. <br> 
     Special harvest regulations for Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie were implemented in 2006 and modified in 2016 after public comment.  All bass 14.0 inches and larger must be immediately released with the exception of one over 20.0 inches allowed in possession.  The Black Crappie regulation is a 10.0-inch minimum length limit.  These regulations were implemented in an attempt to maintain or improve the size structures of these species. <br>

 Narrative = '<p>     Otter Tail Lake is a 13,725 acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County.  The city of Ottertail, MN abuts the east shoreline of the lake.  Otter Tail Lake is part of the Otter Tail River chain of lakes.  Rush, Big Pine, and Little Pine Lakes are located upstream, while Deer, East Lost, West Lost, and Red River Lakes are located downstream.  Primary inlets are the Otter Tail River, which is located along the north shoreline and the Dead River, which is located along the northwest shoreline.  The Otter Tail River outlet is located along the southwest shoreline.  Otter Tail Lake has a maximum depth of 120 feet; however, 57% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2015 survey was 7.2 feet.   <br> 
     The majority of the lake is surrounded by residential and commercial development.  State owned public water accesses are located on the north, northeast, and southwest shorelines.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand interspersed with gravel.  The lake contains large, shallow flats along most of its perimeter.  Because of the abundant sand substrate, areas of submerged  aquatic vegetation are present but sporadic.  A few remnant stands of hardstem bulrush remain and are located adjacent to the undeveloped parcels.  These areas are important components to the lake.  They provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat during all stages of life and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Bulrush beds are natural shoreline stabilizers, reducing erosion caused from wave action and they can even absorb pollutants from the water.  Because of their ecological value, bulrush may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> 
     Otter Tail Lake is a very popular lake for both open water and winter angling.  Although it is known primarily as a Walleye lake, Otter Tail is one of the few lakes in the area that supports a quality Yellow Perch fishery.  A creel survey was conducted in 2006 and 2007 (summer, winter, summer) and the survey showed that 95% of summer anglers and 71% of ice anglers were targeting Walleye.  Winter anglers targeted Yellow Perch more than summer anglers during this creel. <br> 
     A Lake Sturgeon re-introduction plan was implemented in 2002 when yearling Lake Sturgeon were stocked into Otter Tail Lake.  Lake Sturgeon fingerlings have been stocked on an annual basis since 2004.  Lake Sturgeon ranged in length from 13.5 to 50.8 inches with an average length and weight of 36.0 inches and 6.5 pounds. <br> 
     A moderate density Northern Pike population exists.  Age data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 17.6 to 33.9 inches with an average length and weight of 25.6 inches and 4.0 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 27.1 inches at five years of age.  An experimental minimum length limit regulation began on Otter Tail Lake in May 2003.  All pike less than 30-inches must be immediately returned to the water.  Thirteen percent of the pike were 30.0 inches or greater in length.   <br> 
     Yellow Perch size structure and abundance has remained stable in recent surveys.  Age data indicate that 2013 year class is very strong and should provide good angling in the future.  Eight percent of the perch were 8.0 inches or greater in length.  Yellow Perch attain an average length of 7.5 inches at four years of age. <br> 
     Walleye abundance has also remained stable in recent surveys.  Walleyes ranged in length from 7.2 to 23.5 inches with a mean length and weight of 13.2 inches and 0.9 pounds.  The 2013 year class is very strong and should provide good Walleye angling in the future.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.4 inches at four years of age.   <br> 
     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of fishing for all species of fish in Otter Tail Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for eating.  Releasing medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish and should provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br>

The immediate watershed is primarily composed of residential areas interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Pebble Lake is 62 feet; however, 39% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2011 lake survey was 9.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 7.3 to 15.8 feet.   <br> 
     The south and west shorelines of Pebble Lake have been extensively developed into residential areas.  A city park with a public water access and campground is located along the north shoreline of the lake.  A city park, swimming beach, and golf course are located along the southwest shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and rubble.  Emergent aquatic macrophytes such as hardstem bulrush or common cattail are rare except for an extremely small area along the north shoreline. <br> 
     Pebble Lake is a popular angling lake because it is in close proximity to an urban area.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, walleye, black crappie, and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species. <br> 
     A high-density northern pike population exists.  Northern pike ranged in length from 14.7 to 31.3 inches with an average length and weight of 20.5 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 22.2 inches at three years of age. <br> 
     Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that Pebble Lake has a balanced largemouth bass population.  Largemouth bass reproduction appears to be consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 9.5 to 19.3 inches with an average length and weight of 15.7 inches and 2.2 pounds. <br> 
    The bluegill and black crappie populations are abundant.  Eleven percent of the bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.

 Narrative = '<p>     Pelican Lake is located in northwestern Otter Tail County approximately seven miles north of Pelican Rapids, MN.  Pelican Lake is a 3,986-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake that is located within the Otter Tail River Watershed.  The southern portion of the lake (309 acres) is referred to as Fish Lake.  Pelican Lake is connected to Little Pelican Lake and Lake Lizzie via the Pelican River. The Pelican River inlet is located along the east shoreline of the lake while the outlet is located along the south shoreline of Fish Lake.  The Pelican River is navigable by boat upstream to Little Pelican Lake.  A dam at the outlet impedes navigability downstream to Lake Lizzie.  The maximum depth of Pelican Lake is 55 feet; however, 41% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  Historic secchi disk readings have ranged from 5.4 to 13.0 feet. <br> 
     The shoreline of Pelican Lake has been extensively developed.  Homes, cottages, and resorts compose the majority of the development.  DNR owned concrete public water accesses are located along the east and southwest shorelines of the lake.  Pelican Lake is listed as a designated infested water.  Zebra Mussels were discovered in Pelican Lake in September 2009. Remnant stands of hardstem bulrush and wild rice are scattered along various shorelines of the lake.  A large stand of hardstem bulrush is located along the north shoreline of the entrance into Fish Lake. Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and wild rice provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.   <br> 
     Pelican Lake is a popular angling lake during both the open water and ice fishing seasons.  The lake is best known for its excellent Walleye, Northern Pike, and Bluegill fishing.  Data from the population assessment indicate that these species are abundant.  Pelican Lake is also becoming renowned as a trophy Muskellunge lake.   <br> 
     Walleye is a primary management specie in this lake.  Walleye abundance has exceeded the long range goal in each of the six most recent surveys.   The 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2013 year classes appear to be strong and should provide consistently good Walleye angling for several years.  Walleyes ranged in length from 9.9 to 28.5 inches with an average length and weight of 16.2 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.8 inches at four years of age.   <br> 
     Northern Pike population characteristics have demonstrated stability over the recent series of assessments.  The pike population has remained at a moderate density since the 1983 survey and natural reproduction has continued to be consistently good.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 13.5 to 32.1 inches with an average length of 22.8 inches.  Pike attain an average length of 22.8 inches at four years of age. <br> 
     The Muskellunge population can be characterized as a trophy fishery; a low-density population with fish of quality size.  Muskellunge sampled via large-frame trap nets ranged in length from 25.2 to 51.7 inches with a mean length of 43.6 inches.  Muskellunge sampled via spring electrofishing ranged in length from 34.0 to 50.0 inches with a mean length of 44.6 inches.  The DNR will continue to manage Pelican Lake as a trophy Muskellunge fishery. <br> 
     Bluegill abundance has fluctuated over the recent series of assessments.  Bluegill size structure appears to be good.  Twenty-four percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 6.8 inches at five years of age. <br> 
     Catch data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicate that the Black Crappie population is very abundant with an excellent size structure.  Forty-seven percent of the Black Crappies were 10.0 or greater in length.  Black Crappies attain a mean length of 9.8 inches at four years of age. <br> 
     A low-density Smallmouth Bass population exists in Pelican Lake.  Smallmouth Bass test-net catch rates have historically been low.  Suitable spawning habitat and/or juvenile nursery areas may be factors limiting Smallmouth Bass abundance.   <br> 
    Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.   <br>

 Narrative = '<p>Pickerel Lake is a 65-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in east-central Otter Tail county, approximately two miles south of the City of Otter Tail, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed of pasture interspersed with hardwood woodlots. The maximum depth is 73 feet and 60% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The shoreline length is 1.7 miles.  The secchi disk reading, which is a standard measure of water clarity, was 16.0 feet.  The only previous survey of this lake was conducted in 1964, at which time the secchi disk reading was reduced to 2.0 feet due to excessive algae.  Heavy algae blooms are often an indicator of excess nutrients.  This change in clarity likely represents an improvement in water quality.  There was a turkey farm present on the lake in 1964.  In addition, the entire north shore was pastured.  Pickerel Lake is included in lake class 30 of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) lake classification scheme.      Lakeshore development is limited as only five residences are present.  A county owned unimproved public water access is located on the east shore. The predominant shoreline substrate is sand.  The most common types of emergent vegetation are hardstem bulrush and common cattail.  Stands of these plants are scattered around the entire lake, but they are most abundant at the east end.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and help absorb excess nutrients.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including northernpike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit.     Pickerel Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, and bluegill are the dominant fish species in Pickerel Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.     A high-density northern pike population exists.  The northern pike gill net catch rate exceeded the upper limit of the normal range for class 30 lakes.  Age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.  Pike ranged in length from 17.2 to 29.5 inches with an average length and weight of 22.1 inches and 2.5 pounds.  Northern pike growth is slow with an average length of 17.8 inches at four years of age.  The extremely low abundance of yellow perch, a preferred forage fish,is probably limiting northern pike growth.  Northern pike were stocked periodically from 1971 to 1982.           Test-net catch data suggest that largemouth bass are abundant.  Bass ranged in length from 4.2 to 14.3 inches.  Age data indicate that bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass growth rates are slow with an average length of 6.9 inches at three years of age.     The bluegill trap net catch rate was within the normal range for class 31 lakes.  Age data indicate that bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Two percent of the bluegill sampled were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegill reach an average length of 6.2 inches at six years of age.      Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.

 Narrative = '<p>       Pleasant Lake is a 370-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located five miles north of Underwood, MN in central Otter Tail County.  Pleasant Lake is connected to Little Pleasant Lake via an unnavigable culvert under a township road along the north shoreline.  The lake has a maximum depth of 38 feet; however, 64% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 17.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.0 to 13.5 feet.   <br> 
     The immediate watershed of Pleasant Lake consists of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  A majority of the shoreline remains undeveloped.  A DNR owned concrete public access is located along the north shoreline.   Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel. Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and common cattail are prevalent around the entire lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as an important nursery area for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.   <br> 
     Pleasant Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in Pleasant Lake.   <br> 
     Northern Pike abundance is at a moderate level.   Age data indicate that pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern Pike size structure has increased in recent surveys.  Sixty percent of the pike were 24.0 inches or greater in length.  Northern Pike growth is fast; pike attain an average length of 24.0 inches at four years of age. <br> 
     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced Largemouth Bass population exists.  Age data indicate that bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 5.7 to 19.5 inches with an average length and weight of 13.1 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Largemouth Bass attain an average length of 11.8 inches at four years of age.      <br> 
     Data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicate that an abundant Black Crappie population with a good size structure exists.  Twenty-eight percent of the crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 10.4 inches at five years of age. <br> 
     Bluegills are extremely abundant.  Bluegill abundance has historically remained high.  Bluegill size structure has improved from previous surveys with 23% of the sample measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length.   Bluegills attain an average length of 7.4 inches at seven years of age. <br> 
     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br>

 Lake Clarity = '' 
 Narrative = '<p>Portage Lake is a 265-acre lake located in central Otter Tail County.  The maximum depth is 49 feet with 56% of the lake 15 feet or less in depth.  The shoreline length is 2.6 miles and the secchi disk reading for this survey was 14.2 feet.  Secchi disk readings, a measurement of water clarity, have ranged from a low of 8.5 feet to a high of 16.0 feet.  A recently renovated DNR public access is located along the east shoreline.  Portage Lake is included in class 31 of the MNDNR lake classification scheme.       Development on the lake is low to moderate.  Year-round homes and cabins compose the existing development.  There is an operating farm located on the northeast part of the lake.  There are no resorts located on the lake.  Lakeshore development has been shown to negatively impact water quality by increasing nutrient levels and shoreline erosion.  This can result in increased plankton/algae blooms, aquatic plant growth and suspended sediments, all of which can lead to decreased water clarity.  By using best management practices (BMP's) and "lakescaping concepts", impacts of shoreline development and erosion can be minimized.  Contact any county extension office for information on BMP's and your local DNR-Fisheries office for information on lakescaping techniques.       Shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Emergent aquatic plants such as hardstem bulrush and cattail are located in areas throughout the basin.  These plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and  are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from erosion and can actually absorb and breakdown polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning habitat for fish species like northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological importance, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the  aquatic habitat.       A special gill net assessment was conducted in 2001 and 2004 as part of a research project to evaluate walleye stocking.  Trap nets were not set during either of these assessments.       Walleye is the primary management specie in Portage Lake.  The walleye test-net catch rate exceeded the upper limit of the normal range for class 31 lakes.  The walleye catch rate has exceeded the upper limit in every survey conducted.  Walleye ranged in length from 8.9 to 25.4 inches with a mean length and weight of 12.6 inches and 0.7 pounds.  The 2001 and 2003 year classes appear to be strong and should provide consistently good walleye angling for several years.  Walleye attain an average length of 13.7 at four years of age.       Data from past and recent test-netting assessments indicate that walleye natural reproduction is very limited in Portage Lake and that walleye fingerling stocking and fry stocking are maintaining the population.  Catch rate data over the recent series of surveys indicate that the walleye population can be maintained at or above management goals by stocking walleye fry or fingerlings on a biennial basis.  The DNR does not stock any fish species other than walleye in Portage Lake.  The other species present are able to sustain their levels at or above management goals without stocking.  This is an indication of the excellent water quality and fish habitat that is available.  To maintain the excellent fishing that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the water quality and fish habitat.       Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch that trophy fish in the future.  </p>'

The Pomme de Terre River flows through the lake, and a dam at the outlet maintains lake depth.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of the lake is 37 feet, and 51% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading, which is a measure of water clarity, was 10.0 feet in the 2007 survey.  Previous secchi disk readings were 6.5 feet in 1974 and 15.0 feet in 1984. <br> 
     The lake is largely undeveloped, and there is no public access. Anglers can expect to catch bluegill, black crappie, largemouth bass and northern pike. Submerged aquatic vegetation is dense in shallow areas.  Hardstem bulrush, wild rice and cattails are present in several areas around the lake.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines from erosion and can actually absorb and break down pollutants.  Because of their ecological importance, bulrush and cattails may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> 
     Walleye are present in low numbers, and private parties stocked the lake with fingerlings in 1999 and 2006.  Only two walleye were sampled in the 2007 survey measuring 6.1 and 22.1 inches.  MNDNR does not stock the lake due to the lack of a public access. <br> 
     Northern pike from gill nets ranged in length from 14.4 - 29.1 inches, with a mean length and weight of 22.1 inches and 2.3 pounds.    <br>

The secci disk reading during the 2004 lake survey was 5.9 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 5.2 to 10.0 feet.  Periodic plankton/algae blooms throughout the summer months can influence secchi disk readings.  Sand Lake is susceptible to winterkill during severe winters and most recently experienced a partial winterkill during the winter of 1996-1997.  Sand Lake is included in class 38 of the MN DNR lake classification scheme.     The majority of the shoreline of Sand Lake has not been developed.  Within the past couple years, four new homes have been built on the south shoreline and more lots have been developed to build on.  A state owned public access is located off State Hwy 59 along the east shoreline of the lake.  Because of high water levels, the concrete access gets covered by sand and can be a problem when putting in and taking out watercraft.  The shoal water substrates consist of sand, gravel, and muck.  Stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along the shoreline of the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, andpanfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain excellent water quality and angling that our county lakes have to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.     The northern pike and walleye populations appear to be in good shape.  Some spawning habitat is available for these species.  Northern pike up to 35.0 inches and walleye up to 27.0 inches were sampled in 2004.  Northern pike mean length at capture was 22.0 inches, while walleye mean length at capture was 20.4 inches.  Walleye fry are stocked every other year to supplement natural reproduction.     Historically, bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass numbers are very low or nonexistent; however, the bluegill and black crappie populations appear to have responded well to the lack of any recent winterkill.  The 2000 and 2001 year classes appear to be good natural reproduction years for both species.  Largemouth bass were not sampled during the 2004 assessment.  In order to reestablish a largemouth bass population, the stocking of some prespawn adult bass may be needed.     The test-net catch rate for black bullhead was the highest recorded.  Black bullhead numbers are also driven by the frequency of winterkill and appear to have responded well to the lack of recent winterkills.       The establishment of fish populations in Sand Lake is dependent on the frequency of winterkill.  If gamefish populations have time to establish, then Sand Lake can provide good angling opportunity.  Anglers can also maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.</p>'

     A special regulation for Largemouth Bass was implemented in 2005.  The regulation is a 12-inch maximum size limit with one over 20.0 inches allowed in possession.  The objective of the regulation is to maintain or improve the size structure of the Largemouth Bass population.  The regulation will be reviewed and will either be dropped, extended, or modified in the fall of 2014.   <br> 
     Bluegill abundance and size structure fluctuates considerably due to inconsistent year class strength.  In this assessment, 7% of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.   Bluegills attain an average length of 6.7 inches at five years of age.      <br> 
     Walleye are moderately abundant in this lake.  Walleye size structure is good.  Walleyes ranged in length from 8.3 to 28.5 inches with an average length and weight of 15.3 inches and 1.5 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 13.1 inches at three years of age.  <br> 
     Anglers can maintain the quality fishing that this lake has to offer by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in the future. <br>

 Survey Date = '2007-07-30',  County Name = 'Otter Tail', Lake Name = 'Silver' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/30/2007 Clarity: 5.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>     Silver Lake is a 247-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in north central Otter Tail County approximately 2.5 miles east of the city Frazee.  Silver Lake outlets into Murphy Lake by a non-navigable channel under county road 118.  Silver Lake is part of the Otter Tail River watershed and the immediate watershed is composed primarily of marshland and hardwood lots interspersed with agricultural land.  Silver Lake has a maximum depth of 34 feet; however 91% of the surface acreage is less than 15 feet deep.  Shoal water substrates consist of sand and muck.  The lake is sparsely developed.  A DNR owned public water access is located on the north shoreline directly east of the outlet.  The secchi disk reading in this survey was 5.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 2.6 to 4.7 feet.   <br> 
     Silver Lake is subject to periodic partial winterkill.  Past partial winterkills have occurred during the winters of 1988-1989, 1992-1993, and 1996-1997.  Silver Lake is included in lake class 38 of the MNDNR lake classification scheme.  Other lakes in the Fergus Falls management area that are in lake class 38 include:  Buchanan, Elbow, Prairie, Round, and Sand. <br> 
     Large areas of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are present around the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> 
     Silver Lake is a classic bass/panfish lake, where there is little to no natural walleye reproduction occurring.  Past walleye fry stockings weren't reaching the management goals so the current lake management plan calls for walleye fry stockings only after a partial winterkill occurs.  The walleyes that were sampled during the 2007 assessment correspond to years that Murphy Lake was stocked with fry. <br> 
     At times Silver Lake can provide some excellent bluegill fishing.  Bluegills are abundant and in past surveys showed good size structure.  Even though only 10% of the bluegills sampled during the 2007 assessment were 7.0 inches or greater, a special spring trap net assessment in 2001 had 33% of the bluegill sample seven inches or greater. <br> 
     The northern pike abundance has greatly increased while the size structure has slowly improved from past surveys.  Pike sampled by gill nets ranged in length form 13.2 to 28.8 inches with a mean length at capture of 19.4 inches.  This was the first survey where northern pike over 24 inches were sampled.  Seven percent of the northern pike sampled were 24 inches or greater.  The increase in northern pike abundance appears to have had an impact on the yellow perch population, as this was the first survey where a yellow perch was not sampled by a gill net.   <br> 
     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br>

The immediate watershed is composed of hardwood woodlots.  It has a maximum depth of 140 feet; however, 34% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The shoreline length is 3.3 miles.  The secchi disk reading was 17.6 feet.  The secchi disk reading in previous surveys ranged from 8.5 to 19.5 feet.   <br> 
      Lakeshore development is located primarily along the west and north shorelines.  A DNR owned public access is located along the south shoreline.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Hardstem bulrush and cattails are located in various areas throughout the lake.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and can actually absorb and breakdown polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants also provide spawning habitat for fish species such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their significant ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed from the lake without a DNR permit. <br> 
     Walleye is a primary management specie in Lake Six.  Walleye abundance was in the normal range for this type of lake.  Walleyes ranged in length from 12.7 to 22.4 inches with an average length and weight of 16.6 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.7 inches at four years of age.   <br> 
     An abundant Northern Pike population exists.  Pike ranged in length from 8.7 to 31.9 inches with an average length and weight of 20.2 inches and 1.8 pounds.  Northern Pike attain an average length of 21.5 inches at five years of age.     <br> 
     A balanced Largemouth Bass population is present.  Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Bass ranged in length from 7.4 to 13.5 inches with an average length of 11.1 inches.  Largemouth Bass attain an average length of 11.0 inches at four years of age. <br> 
     Bluegill abundance has historically fluctuated due to inconsistent reproduction.  Bluegill abundance in this survey was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Thirty-one percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.0 inches at seven years of age. <br> 
     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of their fishing experience for all species in Lake Six by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large fish while allowing the harvest of the more numerous, smaller fish for eating.  Releasing medium to large fish ensures that the lake will have enough spawning aged fish and will also provide anglers with opportunities to catch larger fish in the future. <br>

South Lida Lake is connected to North Lida Lake by a navigable culvert under State Highway 108 along the north shoreline of the lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of hardwood forest.  The maximum depth is 48 feet; however, 42% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2015 lake survey was 4.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.5 to 9.3 feet.   <br> 
     The south and west shorelines of South Lida Lake have been extensively developed with homes and cabins.  A majority of the east shoreline is located within the boundaries of Maplewood State Park.  A DNR owned public water access is located within the state park along the southeast shoreline and a private access is located along the north shoreline.  A public swimming beach and campground are also located along the east shoreline in the state park.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along the undeveloped sections of shoreline.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> 
     South Lida Lake can be ecologically classified as a Walleye-centrarchid type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Walleye, Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species. <br> 
     Walleyes ranged in length from 10.0 to 27.7 inches with an average length and weight of 17.5 inches and 2.1 pounds.  Age data indicate that the 2012 year class is strong and should provide good Walleye angling in the future.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.9 inches at age four. <br> 
     Recent surveys have shown an increase in Northern Pike abundance.  Age and length data indicate that pike reproduction is consistent.  Pike ranged in length from 14.6 to 32.5 inches with an average length and weight of 22.2 inches and 2.5 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 24.0 inches at age four.  <br> 
     Data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicate that Black Crappies are abundant and have a good size distribution.  Black Crappies ranged in length from 4.4 to 12.7 inches with an average length of 10.1 inches.  Thirty percent of crappies sampled were 11.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 11.2 inches at five years of age. <br> 
     The Bluegill population is very abundant and has a moderate size structure.  Twelve percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.4 inches at four years of age. <br> 
     Harvest regulations for Walleye and Black Crappie have been implemented on South Lida Lake.  The Walleye regulation is a 17.0 to 26.0 inch protected slot limit with one over 26.0 inches allowed in possession.  The Black Crappie regulation is an 11-inch minimum length limit.  The intent of these regulations is to improve the size structure of these populations. <br>

Swan Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Black Crappie, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in Swan Lake.   <br> 
     A high-density Northern Pike population exists.  Age data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good. Northern Pike ranged in length from 12.6 to 32.8 inches with an average length and weight of 20.4 inches and 1.9 pounds. Northern Pike attain an average length of 24.4 inches at five years of age.   <br> 
     Data from a spring electrofishing assessment indicate that a balanced Largemouth Bass population exists.  Bass ranged in length from 7.5 inches to 20.0 inches with an average length and weight of 14.4 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Age data indicate that Largemouth Bass reproduction is consistently good.  Largemouth Bass attain an average length of 13.7 inches at four years of age.   <br> 
     Blluegill abundance exceeds the normal range for this type of lake.  Bluegill abundance and size structure tends to fluctuate due to inconsistent reproduction.  Twenty-four percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.0 inches at six years of age.   <br> 
     Data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicate that the Black Crappie population is abundant and a good size structure exists.  Fifty-one percent of the Black Crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 9.9 inches at five years of age.  <br> 
     Walleye abundance has remained stable in recent surveys.  Walleyes ranged in length from 10.3 to 27.3 inches with an average length and weight of 19.2 inches and 2.7 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 16.7 inches at four years of age.   <br> 
     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing in Swan Lake by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br>

Sybil Lake is connected to Loon Lake via an unnavigable inlet along the west shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  Sybil Lake has a maximum depth of 74 feet; however, 60% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.   The secchi disk reading during the 2013 lake survey was 12.2 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 10.8 to 18.0 feet.    <br> 
     Moderate development exists along the shoreline of Sybil Lake.  Homes and cottages compose the majority of the development.  A DNR owned public access is located on the south shoreline of the lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel with some areas of rubble.  Emergent vegetation (common cattails and hardstem bulrush) is located primarily in the southwest basin.  These areas provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical for maintaining good water quality in the lake.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Largemouth Bass.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their important ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent angling this lake has to offer it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> 
     Walleye abundance has increased from previous surveys.  Walleyes ranged in length from 8.2 to 28.5 inches with an average length and weight of 14.8 inches and 1.3 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.9 inches at four years of age. <br>

 Narrative = '<p>     Tamarac Lake is a 392-acre eutrophic (fertile) located in northwestern Otter Tail County approximately ten miles north of Pelican Rapids, MN.  The immediate watershed is composed of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of Tamarac Lake is 11 feet.  The secchi disk reading during the 2010 lake survey was 5.6 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.6 to 8.2 feet.  Tamarac Lake was susceptible to periodic winterkill; however, an aeration system has been installed and has operated annually since 2004 to minimize winterkill.  As a result, gamefish populations have stabilized.   <br> 
     The majority of the shoreline of Tamarac Lake is developed.  Homes and cottages compose a majority of the development.  A state owned public access is located off of County Road 34 along the south shoreline of the lake. The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and muck.  The only marsh areas on the lake are located in two small bays along the west shore of the lake.  Hardstem bulrush stands are located in the middle of the lake and along the northeast shoreline.  Stands of common cattails are scattered around the entire lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattails provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the water quality and angling this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> 
     A very high-density northern pike population exists.  Northern pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern pike ranged in length from 9.6 to 34.4 inches with an average length and weight of 19.4 inches and 1.6 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 25.1 inches at five years of age. <br> 
     Bluegill abundance is increasing and is within the expected range for this type of lake.  Size structure is good as 84% of the bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.1 inches at four years of age. <br> 
     Black crappie abundance is also increasing and is within the expected range.  Black crappie reproduction appears to be consistently good as five consecutive year classes were sampled.  Thirteen percent of the crappies were 10.0 inches or greater in length.  Crappies attain an average length of 8.3 inches at four years of age. <br> 
     Walleye abundance has historically been very low.  Walleye abundance is likely limited by the high-density pike population via predation.      <br> 
     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.

South Ten Mile Lake is a 1,411-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake that is part of the Pomme de Terre River Watershed.  The Pomme de Terre River inlet is located along the north shoreline while the outlet is located along the south shoreline.  The inlet is navigable by boat through a culvert into North Ten Mile Lake.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  The maximum depth of South Ten Mile Lake is 51 feet; however, 42% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 2016 survey was 6.8 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.0 to 14.5 feet.  Periodic plankton/algae blooms throughout the summer months can influence water clarity in this lake.   <br> 
     The east and west shorelines of South Ten Mile Lake have been extensively developed.  Homes and cottages compose the majority of the development.  A resort is located on the north shoreline.  A DNR owned public access is located along the southeast shoreline. Shoreline development has recently increased in the southern portion of the lake.  Common cattail and hardstem bulrush are prevalent along the shoreline of this bay.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are also located along the south, west, and east shorelines of the main lake basin.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.  A cooperative shoreline stabilization project was completed in 1999.  The DNR, in conjunction with the lake association and private landowners installed rock rip-rap to stabilize several areas of shoreline that were experiencing varying degrees of erosion. <br> 
     South Ten Mile Lake is a popular angling lake.  Species most sought after are Walleye, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and Bluegill.  Data from recent lake surveys indicate that these species are abundant and have good size structures.  Bowfishing for Common Carp is also a popular sport on this lake.   <br> 
     Walleye is a primary management specie in this lake.  Walleye abundance has historically been high in South Ten Mile Lake.  Age data indicate that the 2013 year class is strong and should provide consistently good Walleye angling for several years.  Walleyes ranged in length from 7.2 to 20.6 inches with an average length and weight of 14.6 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Walleyes attain an average length of 14.7 inches at four years of age. <br> 
     Annual fall electrofishing assessments are conducted to index Walleye year class strength resulting from natural reproduction.  Based on catch data collected from this assessment, the 2016 year class of Walleye appears to be very strong.   <br> 
     Bluegills are abundant and the size structure is excellent with 75% of the sample measuring 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.9 inches at five years of age. <br> 
     Smallmouth Bass ranged in length from 8.0 to 19.3 inches with an average length and weight of 14.4 inches and 1.9 pounds.  Smallmouth Bass attain an average length of 15.2 inches at four years of age.   <br> 
     A spring electrofishing assessment was conducted to analyze the Largemouth Bass population.  Data indicate that the Largemouth Bass population is abundant and has a good size structure.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 5.5 to 18.8 inches with an average length and weight of 16.1 inches and 2.4 pounds.  Largemouth Bass attain an average length of 13.0 inches at four years of age.      <br> 
     A 21-inch minimum size limit for Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass was implemented in 2001 and remained in effect through 2012.  The objective of the regulation was to improve the size structure of the Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass populations. Based upon population data, the 21-inch minimum length limit was amended to a 14.0 to 20.0 inch protected slot limit with one over 20.0 inches allowed in possession.   <br> 
        Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.      <br>

 Lake Clarity = '' 
 Narrative = '<p>Tonseth Lake is located in west-central Otter Tail County approximately eight miles southeast of Erhard, MN.  Tonseth Lake is a 156-acre moderately fertile lake that is part of the Otter Tail River Watershed.  Two small intermittent inlets are located along the north shoreline of the lake and an outlet to Kempfer Lake is located along the northwest shoreline.  The inlets and outlet are not navigable.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of undeveloped mixed hardwoods.  The maximum depth of Tonseth Lake is 27 feet; however, 50% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  The secchi disk reading during the 1999 lake survey was 13.7 feet which indicates excellent water clarity.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 7.0 to 18.5 feet.  Periodic plankton/algae blooms throughout the summer months can influence secchi disk readings   The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different lake classes based on physical and chemical characteristics of the lakes.  Tonseth Lake is included in lake class 34 of this classification scheme.  Tonseth Lake is located within the DNR's Fergus Falls Management Area.       The majority of the shoreline of Tonseth Lake remains undeveloped.  Homes and cottages are scattered around the lake but the shoreline is primarily composed of mixed hardwoods.  As referenced in the 1994 lake survey, there are 21 homes/cottages located on Tonseth Lake.  The same number of homes/cottages was referenced in the 1981 lake resurvey.  Tonseth Lake does not have a designated public access; however, a DNR leased public access will be constructed in 2000 or 2001.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel with scattered areas of rubble.  Large stands of hardstem bulrush are scattered along the shoreline of the lake.  Common cattail is also prevalent in several of the lakes' bays.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent water quality and angling that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat.       Tonseth Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.   Largemouth bass, northern pike, bluegill, and black crappie are the dominant species in the fish community of Tonseth Lake.  These species are abundant and also exhibit good size structures.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.       Data collected from a spring electrofishing assessment indicated that Tonseth Lake has a balanced largemouth bass population.  Bass ranged in length from 5.2 to 18.9 inches with an average length and weight of 11.3 inches and 1.0 pounds.  Bass reach an average length of 11.3 inches at four years of age.  A creel survey conducted in 1986 indicated that angler catch rates for largemouth bass were excellent.     The northern pike test-net catch rate increased from previous surveys and is within the normal range for lake class 34 lakes.  The increase in pike abundance may be attributed to the recent high water level which has increased the accessability of northern pike to suitable spawning habitat (marsh areas).  Northern pike ranged in length from 17.3 to 34.2 inches with an average length and weight of 23.2 inches and 2.9 pounds.  Northern pike reach an average length of 19.3 inches at four years of age which is slower than average growth rates for pike in class 34 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.     Bluegill test-net catch rates have fluctuated in the recent series of lake surveys; however, the catch rate in this survey exceeded the upper limit of the normal range for lakes in class 34.  Bluegill size distribution and growth rates have remained consistent over recent surveys.  Twenty percent of the bluegills sampled were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills reach an average length of 6.4 inches at six years of age which is at the lower limit of the statewide normal range of growth for lake class 34.       Catch data collected from a special spring trapnetting assessment indicated that black crappie are very abundant in Tonseth Lake.  Black crappies ranged in length from 4.6 to 12.2 inches.  Sixty-seven percent of the crappies sampled were 9.0 inches or greater in length.  Several strong year classes (1995 and 1998) should provide consistently good crappie angling for several years.  Crappies reach an average length of 9.5 inches at five years of age which is slower than average growth rates for crappies in class 34 lakes in the Fergus Falls Management Area.        No fish species are presently stocked in Tonseth Lake; however, a walleye stocking plan will be initiated in 2000 or 2001 contingent upon development of the public access.  The plan identifies a stocking regime of 78 pounds of walleye fingerlings on a biennial basis.  This stocking plan may increase walleye angling opportunities for anglers of Tonseth Lake.       To maintain the excellent fishing this lake presently has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the existing quality of the fish community.  Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for table fare.

The maximum depth is 50 feet; however, 57% of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  The secchi disk reading during the 2004 lake survey was 16.3 feet which indicates excellent water clarity.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 6.5 to 16.0 feet.  Periodic plankton/algae blooms throughout the summer can influence secchi disk readings.  East Twin Lake is included in lake class 31 of the Minnesota DNR lake classification scheme.     The majority of the shoreline of East Twin Lake is undeveloped.  The development that does exist is located along the northeast shoreline.  Fourteen homes/cabins and one resort were recorded during the 2000 lake survey.  A DNR owned concrete public water access is also located along the northeast shoreline.  The shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.

The long-term trend has been an increase in the pike catch rate.  Pike ranged in length from 15.3 to 34.3 inches with an average length and weight of 22.5 inches and 2.6 pounds.  Thirty-three percent of the pike were at least 24.0 inches in length.  Northern pike exhibit fast growth with an average length of 23.8 inches at four years of age.       The walleye test-net catch rate was within the normal range for lake class 31 lakes.  Walleye ranged in length from 15.5 to 28.3 inches with an average length and weight of 19.0 inches and 2.9 pounds.  Age data from recent lake surveys indicate that walleye stocking is maintaining the walleye population by supplementing limited natural reproduction.  The strongest year classes have consistently corresponded to years of walleye stocking.  Walleye also exhibit fast growth with an average length of 16.0 inches at four years of age.     Data from recent assessments indicate that bluegill are very abundant and that the average size tends to be small.  Bluegill growth is also slow; bluegill attain an average length of 6.4 inches at six years of age.     Anglers can maintain or improve the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.

All three bullhead species were sampled during the 2004 assessment, however; only the black bullhead test-net catch rate exceeded the normal range for class 28 lakes.  The yellow bullhead test-net catch rate was within the normal range, while the brown bullhead test-net catch rate was below the normal range.       Only two northern pike were sampled during the assessment.  The lengths of the two pike sampled were 22.9 inches and 24.6 inches.       The yellow perch test-net catch rate was within the normal range for class 28 lakes.  Yellow perch ranged in length from 6.2 to 8.1 inches.       It appears that Flat Lake, like many of our other area's small lakes, may have experienced a partial or entire winterkill during the 1996-97 winter.  The age data indicates there are no fish older than the 1998 year class (5 years old).  Because Flat Lake may be susceptible to winterkill during severe winters it may require occasional stockings, however; because it is a private lake with no public access, the MN DNR does not actively manage the lake.  It does appear that when there is a lack of winterkill the species present are able to sustain their levels without stocking.  This is an indication of the excellent water  quality and fish habitat that is available.  To maintain the fishing that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the water quality and fish habitat.    </p>'

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/04/2014 Clarity: 11' 
 Narrative = '<p>  Walker Lake is a 540-acre eutrophic (fertile) lake located in central Otter Tail County approximately four miles west of Ottertail City.  The Dead River inlet is located along the north shoreline and outlets into Otter Tail Lake along the south shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of marshland and agricultural land interspersed with hardwood woodlots.  Walker Lake has a maximum depth of 29 feet; however, 63% of the lake is less than 15 feet in depth.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and muck.  Development is primarily limited to the north and south shorelines.  A public water access is located along the north shoreline.  The secchi disk reading during the 2014 survey was 11.0 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 4.7 to 5.5 feet.   <br> 
     Large areas of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are present around the lake.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and cattail provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.   <br> 
     Walker Lake is a very popular lake for Walleye fishing, especially during the first two weeks of the season.  Walleyes migrate from Otter Tail Lake through Walker Lake and up the Dead River to spawn in mid to late April.  They return to Walker Lake to feed once spawning is completed and before migrating back to Otter Tail Lake.  Anglers take advantage of this and usually experience some excellent fishing during this time period.  Because the degree of migration can vary from year to year, Walleye abundance can fluctuate greatly.  Walker Lake is stocked annually with Walleye fry to replace eggs taken by the DNR at the Walleye egg-take site at the Walker Lake Hatchery.  Walleyes sampled in this assessment ranged in length from 10.8 to 18.5 inches with an average length and weight of 14.0 inches and 1.3 pounds.     <br> 
     Walker Lake also provides some excellent Bluegill fishing at various times of the year.  Bluegills are abundant and possess a good size structure.  In this assessment, fifty-one percent of the Bluegills measured 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Age data indicate that Bluegill reproduction is consistently good.  Bluegills exhibit fast growth with an average length of 7.2 inches at four years of age.      <br> 
     Anglers can maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future. <br>

Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> 
     Because of the close proximity to Fergus Falls, Wall Lake is a popular angling lake.  Wall Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in Wall Lake.  The prolificacy of these species can be attributed to the abundance of suitable spawning habitat that is available.  <br> 
     A moderate density Northern Pike population exists.  Age data indicate that Northern Pike reproduction is consistently good.  Northern Pike ranged in length from 16.7 to 33.0 inches with an average length and weight of 22.2 inches and 2.5 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 23.2 inches at five years of age.   <br>

      Catch data from recent test-netting and electrofishing assessments indicate that a high-density Largemouth Bass population exists in West McDonald Lake.  Length data from these assessments indicate that the bass population is dominated by small fish.  Age data from recent assessments also indicate that bass reproduction levels are consistently high.  Growth rate estimates indicate that bass growth is slow, most likely due to the high-density population which increases competition for the available forage.  Bass ranged in length from 4.5 to 14.0 inches with an average length and weight of 10.4 inches and 0.6 pounds.  Bass attain an average length of 11.1 inches at four years of age.   <br>

There are no inlets or outlets located on West Olaf.  Water levels are approximately 6 to 8 feet above normal levels, thus making the state owned (DNR) access unusable.  The DNR owned access is located on the northeast shoreline, located just off Co. Rd. 30.  Access is currently gained off of Co. Rd. 30, however parking is limited and not allowed along the waters edge of Co. Rd. 30.  West Olaf Lake is part of the Buffalo River watershed and is composed primarily of agricultural land and interspersed with hardwood lots.  West Olaf Lake has a maximum depth of 61 feet; 51% of the surface acreage is less than 15 feet deep.  The secchi disk reading, a measurement of water clarity, was 8.5 feet.  Past secchi disk readings have ranged from 11.0 to 15.5 feet.  West Olaf Lake is included in lake class 25 of the MNDNR lake classification scheme.  Other lakes in the Fergus Falls management area that are in lake class 25 include:  Bass (Elbow), Beers, Franklin, Jolly Ann, Leek, South Lida, Long, Red River, Schwartz, Sewell, West Silent, East Spirit, Stuart, Swan, and Sybil. <br> 
     The majority of the shoreline is undeveloped.  Shoreline substrates consist primarily of sand scattered with gravel and rubble with some muck mixed in.  The abundance of emergent aquatic plants has been negatively effected by the recent years of high water.  However bulrush and cattail are present in areas throughout the basin.  These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as northern pike, largemouth bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit. <br> 
     Northern pike abundance is low, but the size structure appears to be good as 54% of the northern pike sampled by gill nets were 24-inches or greater.  Age data from recent surveys indicate that pike recruitment is low but it is consistent.  The average length and weight of northern pike sampled by gill nets was 25.1 inches and 3.6 pounds.  Northern pike attain a mean length of 19.3 inches at age-III. <br> 
     Bluegill abundance is considered to be within the normal range for lakes of this type, however the size structure is poor.  Only 4% of the bluegills sampled by trap nets were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Recruitment appears to be consistent as there were seven consecutive year classes sampled.  Bluegill attain a mean length of 5.7 inches at age-V. <br> 
     A spring electrofishing assessment was conducted to analyze the largemouth bass population.  Largemouth sampled during the electrofishing assessment ranged in length from 4.4 to 18.4 inches with an average length and weight of 12.5 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Age and growth data indicate that West Olaf  Lake's bass population is balanced and has low to moderate levels of recruitment, mortality, and growth.  Bass attain a mean length of 11.6 inches at age-IV.   <br> 
     A spring electrofishing assessment was conducted to analyze the black crappie population.  Black crappie sampled during the electrofishing assessment ranged in length from 4.5 to 9.8 inches with a mean length of 7.2 inches.  Although six consecutive year classes were sampled the 2005-year class comprised 52% of the sample and the 2002-year class comprised 19% of the sample.

In this survey only thirteen percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegills attain an average length of 7.2 inches at six years of age. <br> 
     Data from a spring trapnetting assessment indicate that Black Crappies are abundant.  Age data indicate that reproduction is consistently good.  Size structure is also good as 65% of the crappies were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Black Crappies attain an average length of 10.7 inches at five years of age. <br> 
     Data from past spring electrofishing assessments indicate that a high-density, slow growing Largemouth Bass population exists.   <br> 
     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large-size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.   <br>

 Narrative = '<p>     Wimar Lake is a 275 acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located in north central Otter Tail County, approximately four miles northeast of Vergas, MN.  The maximum depth is 58 feet, and 39% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disc reading, a measure of water clarity, was 9.5 feet.  Previous readings have ranged from 6.0 to 10.0 feet.  There is a state owned dam at the outlet on the south end of the lake,   and the outlet flows into the Otter Tail River. There is no public access to the lake. <br> 
     Most of the shoreline is developed, with the exceptions of the south shore and a portion of the east shore.  Shoalwater substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel. Hardstem bulrush exists at several locations around the lake. These emergent plants provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat and are critical in maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms from wave erosion and help absorb excess nutrients.  Emergent plants also provide critical spawning habitat for several fish species including northern pike, largemouth bass and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for many species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants cannot be removed without a DNR permit.  <br> 
     Wimar Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish lake, and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie and bluegill are the dominant gamefish species.  Suitable spawning habitat for these species exists throughout the lake.   <br> 
     Walleye are present in Wimar Lake; however, abundance is low. <br> 
     Northern pike are not abundant in the lake, but the size structure is good.  Northern pike ranged in length from 20.9 to 35.6 inches, with a mean length and weight of 27.3 inches and 4.8 pounds.  Northern pike growth rates are good with an average length of 23.1 inches at age four. <br> 
     Bluegill are abundant, with a trap net catch rate of 127.4 per net, well above that expected for similar lakes.  Average length of bluegill from trap nets was 6.6 inches, and they attain a length of 4.8 inches at age four.   <br> 
     Anglers can help maintain the quality of angling by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish for table fare.

 Narrative = '<p>     Wright Lake is a 63-acre mesotrophic (moderately fertile) lake located within the city limits of Fergus Falls, MN.  Wright Lake is connected to Hoot Lake via a navigable inlet along the north shoreline that is a portion of the Otter Tail River.  The city water plant is located at the outlet along the west shoreline.  The immediate watershed is composed primarily of residential areas and agricultural land.  The maximum depth of Wright Lake is 32 feet; however, 52% of the lake is 15 feet or less in depth.  The secchi disk reading was 7.5 feet.  Previous secchi disk readings have ranged from 7.5 to 9.6 feet. <br> 
     The north and east shorelines of Wright Lake have been extensively developed with year-round homes.  Wright Lake can be accessed from Hoot Lake via a navigable channel between the lakes.  A city owned public water access is located on the south shoreline of Hoot Lake.  Shoal water substrates consist primarily of sand and gravel.  Wild rice is prevalent around the entire shoreline of the lake.  Small stands of hardstem bulrush and common cattail are scattered along various shorelines.  Emergent aquatic plants such as bulrush and wild rice provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, and are critical for maintaining good water quality.  They protect shorelines and lake bottoms, and can actually absorb and break down polluting chemicals.  Emergent plants provide spawning areas for fish such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and panfish.  They also serve as important nursery areas for all species of fish.  Because of their ecological value, emergent plants may not be removed without a DNR permit.  To maintain the excellent angling and water quality that this lake has to offer, it is imperative to preserve the quality of the aquatic habitat. <br> 
     Wright Lake can be ecologically classified as a bass-panfish type of lake and this is reflected in the assemblage of the fish community.  Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass and Bluegill are the dominant gamefish species in the fish community.     <br> 
     Northern Pike ranged in length from 20.0 to 24.3 inches with an average length and weight of 22.6 inches and 2.4 pounds.  Pike attain an average length of 23.7 inches at age-IV. <br> 
     Thirty-five percent of the Bluegills were 7.0 inches or greater in length.  Bluegill growth rates are good with an average length of 7.2 inches at four years of age. <br> 
     Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass were not sampled in this survey.  Data from past electrofishing assessments indicate that these species are abundant and have good size structures.  There is a catch and release regulation for Smallmouth Bass on the Otter Tail River and its impoundments which includes Wright Lake.   <br> 
     Walleyes ranged in length from 13.4 to 18.6 inches with a mean length and weight of 15.9 inches and 1.3 pounds. <br> 
     Three Lake Sturgeon were sampled.  This is the first survey in which Lake Sturgeon have been sampled in Wright Lake. Lake Sturgeon enter Wright Lake by downstream movement from Otter Tail Lake where a Lake Sturgeon re-introduction plan was implemented in 2002. <br> 
     Anglers can maintain the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of medium to large size fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish.  Releasing the medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish on an annual basis and will provide anglers with more opportunities to catch large fish in the future.    <br>

 Survey Date = '2011-08-29',  County Name = 'Pine', Lake Name = 'Bass' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/29/2011 Clarity: 4.7' 
 Narrative = '<p>Bass Lake is a small, moderately fertile lake located in northeastern Kanabec and western Pine counties. Although much of the lake is less the 15 feet, water clarity is higher than most area lakes. The water clarity during the summer ranges from 2 to 11 feet from the surface, and the color varies from light green to clear with occasional bog stain (clear-brown) tint. Rolling hills bound the shoreline with soil types dominated by sandy loam, clay and glacial till. The shoreline is approximately 50% developed with the remaining lake frontage consisting of bogs, woodland and farmland. Bass Lake is managed primarily for walleye, largemouth bass, and northern pike. The current management plan includes the annual stocking of 147 pounds of walleye fingerlings. A public access is located on the northwest shore with parking for approximately seven rigs.   <br> 
 <br> 
During the week of August 29, 2011, Bass Lake was surveyed to evaluate the present fish population. Sampling consisted of six gill net sets, nine trap net sets, and night electrofishing for largemouth bass. <br> 
 <br> 
Despite the shift back from fry to fingerling stocking in 2003, the walleye abundance remains low compared to similar lakes. The single walleye sampled by the gill nets was from the 2003 year class. Eleven walleye were captured during the bass electrofishing. Though these fish weren't aged, their lengths indicated they were likely a result of the 2006 and 2010 fingerling stockings. Walleye currently provide a bonus opportunity to angler targeting other fish species in Bass Lake.   <br> 
 <br> 
The northern pike catch was 6.3 per set, a typical level compared to similar lakes. Northern size remains an issue.  The average pike was 17.1 inches and 1.0 pounds. None of the pike sampled in the nets reached 24 inches in length, however longer fish were captured during the bass electrofishing. Although they were relatively young (most northerns were 2, 3, or 4 years old), growth was slow compared to the statewide rate.   <br> 
 <br> 
One hour and twenty minutes of electrofishing the night of June 1st sampled 48 largemouth bass, yielding the highest catch rate for Bass Lake (38 bass/hr.). Bass ranged from 5.7 to 20.3 inches in length with 60% of the catch exceeding 12 inches.  Five years of growth was required to reach this 12 inch mark.  <br> 
 <br> 
Compared to both similar lakes and prior Bass Lake assessments, bluegill and black crappie numbers were low and high respectively. One third of the bluegill captured exceeded 7 inches while 30% of the crappies surpassed the 9 inch mark. <br> 
 <br> 
In summary, Bass is a small lake with good water clarity that receives light angling pressure. A quality largemouth bass and black crappie fishery is present with additional opportunity for smaller sized northern pike and the occasional larger walleye.</p>'

 Narrative = '<p>Big Pine Lake is a fertile, 387 acre lake located in Pine and Aitkin counties. The lake averages 14 feet with a 22 foot maximum. Water clarity is generally good with a light bog stain, though algae blooms are not uncommon. Lake users can access Big Pine through the public access on the north end of the lake or from the north end of Pine Lake. While natural reproduction of Walleye has occurred, due to limited spawning habitat, Walleye fingerlings are stocked annually.   <br> 
 <br> 
Anglers on North Big Pine can expect moderate fishing pressure. Walleye abundance has decreased since peaking in the 1994 assessment.  Northern Pike are slightly more numerous.  Abundance of both species is below the normal range for the lake class while their average size exceeds the norm. Northerns averaged 25.4 inches and 3.3 pounds. Walleyes ranged from 11.9 to 27.6 inches and averaged 3.3 pounds. Largemouth Bass are in good quantity and of quality size. Bass averaged 15 inches and 1.9 pounds. Yellow Perch are slightly more abundant than five years ago with a catch rate exceeding the lake class norm for the first time since 1999. Perch continue to function primarily as a forage species due to their small sizes. The Bluegill and Black Crappie numbers are more than adequate to warrant angling, with more harvestable sized individuals sampled than in the previous assessment.</p>'

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2000-06-12',  County Name = 'Pine', Lake Name = 'Big Slough' 
 Lake Clarity = '' 
 Narrative = '<p>Big Slough Lake is a moderately fertile 71 acre lake located southeast of the town of Sturgeon Lake in northern Pine County.  Its shape is characterized by a narrow central area that connects two small basins.  The lake is dominated by water depths less than 14 feet with an abundance of submerged vegetation throughout the lake.  Recreational users of Big Slough Lake may find navigation through the central lake narrows somewhat challenging during the summer months due to shallow water depths and dense aquatic plants.  The surrounding shoreline is minimally developed with only ten existing homes while the remaining shoreline is made up of mixed hardwood forest, marshland, and bog land.  Past management has consisted primarily of an initial survey in July of 1967 followed by a resurvey in July of 1984 and a fish house count in 1987.  The current management plan lists northern pike as the primary management species with largemouth bass, bluegill sunfish, and black crappie as the secondary management species.  This plan also calls for a resurvey as per a ten year schedule.  Based on this schedule, a resurvey should have occurred in 1994.  However, due to time constraints and low priority status, the evaluation was postponed until adequate time became available.  Big Slough Lake is considered a low priority lake because of its small size, lack of public access, and self sustaining gamefish population.  The Hinckley Area Fisheries Office determined that a fish population assessment utilizing gill and trap nets followed by shoreline seining would be adequate sampling for the upcoming evaluation.  Revision of the current management plan to a fifteen or twenty year assessment schedule may be a reasonable goal for the future.During the open water season of 2000, a fish population assessment was conducted to evaluate the current status of the fish community.  Some physical and chemical factors concerning habitat, and water quality parameters were also measured.  Fish sampling gear consisted of gill nets, trap nets, and shoreline seining.  Northern pike numbers were found within a normal range for this lake type while the average size, at 4.4 pounds, was well above normal.  Measured northern extended from 16.9 to 34.3 inches.  Largemouth bass were not sampled by gill or trap nets, but young-of-the-year largemouth were captured during shoreline seining which indicates that mature adults are present.  Future management goals should include spring night electrofishing as part of the next assessment since this method has been proven to be more effective at sampling the largemouth population.  Bluegill sunfish abundance and average size were found at normal levels while black crappie numbers were above normal with their size being within a normal range for this type of lake.  Measured bluegill ranged from 2.8 to 8.7 inches with a good number of sunfish between 7.0 and 8.0 inches.  Crappie lengths were distributed fairly evenly from 4.1 to 9.3 inches.  Good natural reproductive success was found for sunfish while largemouth bass and yellow perch showed some success.  Big Slough Lakes fish community was also made up of black, brown, and yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed sunfish, and white sucker.  All of the above species were found at normal levels except brown bullhead which were captured at a below normal level.Historically, anglers seeking panfish or a nice sized northern pike found success at Big Slough Lake.  There has been some concern expressed from local anglers over the past few years regarding the decreasing quality of northern pike size, but according to the 2000 assessment anglers are still likely to hook into a lunker northern pike.  Fishing enthusiasts are just as likely to encounter good numbers of sunfish or crappie as they were previously.  Since Big Slough Lake does not have a public access, acquiring permission from private land owners is essential.  Selective harvest of smaller fish for eating and release of some of the larger ones is encouraged.  Releasing the larger fish will help maintain the current quality of the fish population and provide future angling opportunities for others who would like to experience catching a quality sized fish.  Since land uses within a watershed surrounding a lake influence a lakes water quality, additional nutrient input may decrease this lakes water quality and ultimately its overall health.  Shoreline property owners and surrounding land users within the watershed can maintain or improve water quality by protecting the existing abundance of natural shoreline, developing a shoreline buffer zone of native plant species, updating outdated or failing septic systems, using phosphorus free fertilizer (if needed) on surrounding lawns, gardens, or crop land, utilizing crop farming practices that reduce run-off, limiting aquatic plant removal or disturbance, and limiting construction of impervious surfaces near the shoreline.</p>'

 Survey Date = '2014-06-23',  County Name = 'Pine', Lake Name = 'Cross' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/23/2014 Clarity: 3.9' 
 Narrative = '<p>Cross Lake is a fertile 943 acre lake located near the town of Pine City, MN in southern Pine County. The lake and its fish community are largely influenced by the Snake River that runs through the southern portion. The lake is primarily managed for Walleye and Muskellunge.  Around 500 pounds of Walleye fingerlings and 500 Muskellunge fingerlings are stocked annually. The shore is predominantly sand and is highly developed especially the west shore.  Public access is available on the river just west of the lake and on the east shore near the river outlet. Anglers on Cross Lake should expect moderate to high user pressure from both fishing and recreational boating.  <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye catch rates have typically been low in Cross Lake despite substantial fingerling stocking from 1984 to 1991 and from 2001 to the present.  Walleye sampled during this survey ranged from 9.4 to 11.0 inches. Mean weight, 0.4 pounds, was below average when compared to similar lakes.   <br> 
 <br> 
Muskellunge are not sampled effectively during typical fish population assessments conducted during the summer.  During 2009 a special assessment was conducted during the spring using large trap nets to target Muskellunge. A total of 47 Muskellunge were observed during the survey.  Mean length of sampled fish was 44 inches and lengths ranged from 35.1 to 51.0 inches.  Density was determined to be low, but if you catch one, the chances are that it will be large as 41 out of 47 fish were greater than 40 inches and 5 fish were greater than 50 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
The Northern Pike gill net catch of 0.7 per net was similar to the past two surveys in 2010 and 2005 and remained low when compared to similar lakes. Northern Pike caught in gill nets ranged from 13.5 to 33.4 inches with a mean of 23.0 inches. The mean weight of 3.2 pounds is above average. Catch rates of Northern Pike have typically been low in Cross Lake, with catch rates less than 1.2 fish per net in 7 of the last 9 surveys conducted since 1981. <br> 
 <br> 
Black Crappie catch rates were high when compared to similar lakes. Gill net catch rates have continued on an increasing trend over the last 30 years, while trap net catch rates don't show any apparent trend.  White Crappie on the other hand were observed at historic lows during the 2014 survey at 0.2 per gill net. Some quality sized Black Crappie occur in Cross Lake, as many fish were greater than 8 inches and some fish over 10 inches were sampled.  Only two White Crappie were caught during the survey and were 8 and 9 inches in length.   <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill catch rates in trap nets reached historic highs, but the 2014 catch rate of near 14 per net was still below average when compared to similar lakes. Bluegill mean weight was 0.33 pounds, which was greater than average and similar to the surveys conducted in 2005 and 2010. Keeper sized Bluegill were abundant during the survey, with fish between 6 and 8.5 inches making up 70 percent of the catch.  <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch were sampled at 5.8 fish per gill net, which is just below average when compared to similar lakes. Outside of the high Yellow Perch catch rates recorded during the 1995 and 2000 surveys, catch rates have been between 4 and 12 fish per net. Yellow Perch sampled in gill nets ranged from 5.3 to 9.2 inches with only 10 percent of the catch exceeding 8 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Channel Catfish were sampled at 1.0 fish per gill net, which remains on the low end of observed catch rates. Lengths ranged from 9.8 to 30.0 inches with a mean weight at an historic high for Cross Lake of 5.3 pounds. While the current population appears to be low, a great angling opportunity exists for large fish, with over half of the fish sampled being greater than 26 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Freshwater Drum catch rates in gill nets continue to be lower than the 25th percentile at 0.75 fish per net.  However, trap net catch rates returned to greater than the 75th percentile. Catch rates have decreased during each survey since the high of almost 12 per gill net in 1987.  Freshwater Drum averaged 13.6 inches and 0.55 pounds.  <br> 
 <br> 
Two Lake Sturgeon were present in the gill nets. Other species sampled during the survey include White Sucker, Golden Redhorse, Shorthead Redhorse, Silver Redhorse, Black Bullhead, Yellow Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Painted Turtle, Snapping Turtle, and Softshell Turtle. <br> 
 <br> 
Quality fishing opportunities exist for multiple species in Cross Lake. At times fishing pressure on Cross Lake can be high and anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest to help maintain and improve the quality of Cross Lake's fishery. Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while allowing the harvest of more abundant smaller fish.  Releasing medium to large fish will help restore and maintain fish community balance, as well as increase opportunities to catch large fish in the future.   <br> 
 <br> 
Non-native invasive species of vegetation are present in Cross Lake. Eurasian Watermilfoil and Curlyleaf Pondweed are both present, anglers and boaters should take necessary precautions to prevent the further spread of invasive species. <br> 
 <br> 
Some shorelines of Cross Lake are highly developed, which can put stress on the lake's aquatic habitat and ecosystem integrity.  Environmentally friendly development practices, such as shoreline buffer strips of natural vegetation, are encouraged to help maintain and improve the water quality of Cross Lake. Also, if trees and branches have fallen in the water, consider leaving them where they are to provide important habitat for fish and wildlife that is often missing in highly developed lakes. <br>

The lakes clear water and sandy shores are popular with swimmers, though no public beach is designated.   <br> 
 <br> 
Dago Lake was used by the Hinckley Area Fisheries office to rear walleye fingerlings (1977-1985, 1989-1992) with varying success.  High water levels from the mid 1980's to the early 1990's allowed fish migration from Sturgeon Lake.  The 1986 assessment found the lake 7 feet above the current level.  The establishment of game fish populations and the lack of winter kill have now limited the lakes use as walleye rearing pond.  The up side is angling opportunities are now present in the Day Use Area .   <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike were near the 75th percentile in both number and size when compared to similar lakes.  The eleven northerns present in the gill net ranged from 14.9 to 31.5 inches and averaged 20.5 inches and 2.6 pounds.  Black crappie and bluegill were also present in normal abundance.  Trap netted crappie ranged from 4.3 to 9.7 inches with an average of 6.6 while bluegill ranged from 3.1 to 8.1 with a 5.6 inch average.  Crappie and bluegill both averaged 0.16 pounds, which just fell in the normal range for bluegill but below the 25th percentile for black crappie.  Largemouth bass were moderately abundant, with a catch rate of 34 per hour of electrofishing.  Bass were quality sized ranging from 10 to 19.3 inches with an average of 13.1 inches and 1.4 pounds.  The proportions of the bass catch exceeding 12 and 16 inches were 70% and 20% respectively.  Species present in lower abundance included black bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, walleye, and yellow perch.     <br>

The shoreline surrounding the lake has minimal development with most of the shoreline made up of undeveloped mixed hardwood forest, marshland, and grassland.  The fishery is managed primarily for northern pike with largemouth bass, bluegill sunfish, and black crappie as the secondary management species. The lakes fertility and shallow nature has led to low oxygen levels some winters.  Fish Lake has experienced winterkill in the past with the lake being opened to unlimited fishing in 1997. <br> 
 <br> 
A lake survey was conducted in June of 2010 to evaluate the current status of the lake's fish population and water quality.  Compared to similar lakes, northern pike, black crappie, and bluegill numbers were normal, while black bullhead and yellow perch numbers were low. <br> 
  <br> 
Anglers wishing to access Fish Lake will have to obtain permission through private property owners.  Harvestable black crappies and quality sized northern pike are present.  Well over half of the netted northerns exceeded 24 inches and fish over 30 inches were present.  Likewise, more than half the black crappies were over 8 inches, a size acceptable to many anglers.  Bluegill numbers are on the rise but most are too small to warrant harvest.  Yellow perch have declined dramatically since the 2000 assessment, likely due to northern pike predation.  Because the lake has the potential for some degree of winterkill, the fish population is subject to change.</p>'

 Lake Clarity = '' 
 Narrative = '<p>On June 16, 1993, a lake survey was conducted on Greigs Lake (lake class 20).  Standard netting and electrofishing methods were used to evaluate the present fish population status.  Greigs is managed for largemouth bass, northern pike, and panfish, however, little can be done to this lake due to its small size and lack of an official public access.  This lake, also known as Lake Ten, was named after former conservation officer Sheridan Greig.  He had his place of residence there, which is now St. Croix Camp II.  Local historians claim that Sheridan Greigs stocked lake sturgeon (circa 1930's) and trout into this lake.  Unofficial catches of lake sturgeon have been reported the past 20 years.Northern pike abundance was normal for this type of lake with fish averaging 20.1 inches.  The average weight was 1.7 pounds.  Ages 4-6 were sampled with growth being typical of normal.Largemouth bass abundance was high with fish ranging from 5.4 to 17.2 inches.  The average length was 10.5 inches and the average weight was 0.8 pounds.  Ages 3-9 were sampled with growth being slower than normal.The bluegill abundance was normal for this lake type with fish up to 7.2 inches.  Average lengths were 4.7 inches and average weights were 0.08 pounds.  The bluegills ran small and were thin in appearance.The black crappie abundance was very low with only 4 fish being sampled ranging from 4.8 to 10.3 inches.Yellow perch have historically had low numbers in this lake.  The northern pike most likely keep the perch numbers down.  Pumpkinseeds have usually faired well with the bluegills.  Their abundance was above normal and their average length was 5.6 inches.The remainder of the fish population consisted of:  brown bullhead, hybrid sunfish, and yellow bullhead.  Their abundance levels were below normal for this type of lake.It would appear after reading this report that the overall fish population is low or fish tend to be small.  This is partially true in some regards since deep, clear, less fertile lakes like Greigs are prone to have low fish populations.  What usually occurs is that a few species do well in abundance and size/age ratio.  Other species may be lacking in presence or be abundant, but stunted to some degree.Prepared by:  Jack Lauer, Area Fisheries Specialist</p>'

 Narrative = '<p>Indian Lake is a shallow 73-acre basin located in north-west Pine County that has been assigned to lake class 37.  The lake is managed primarily for northern pike and black crappie and secondarily for largemouth bass and bluegill sunfish.  There is no established public water access.  The lakeshore is lightly developed with only four dwellings.  The lake is high in fertility resulting in poor water clarity.  Shoreline substrate is predominately sand.  Fishing pressure is light.  The lake's shallow and fertile nature makes it susceptible to low winter oxygen levels.  Fluctuating species composition and panfish abundance in past assessments point to irregular winter kills.  <br>

The northern pike abundance, based on gill net catch rate, has been low in all assessments.  The catch rate was low again in 2008 at just 0.5 pike per net lift.  Both measured northerns were over 30 inches in length.  Yellow perch abundance, though above the 25th percentile for the lake class, was markedly lower than the previous assessments.   <br>

Black crappie numbers and size were above normal levels based on the trap net catch.  Crappie ranged from 4.4 to 12.5 inches with an average of 9.3 inches and half a pound.  Bluegill sunfish also exceeded the norm in size but their abundance was typical of the lake class.  Most bluegill (55%) were 7 inches or better in length while 20% of the catch exceeded 8 inches.   <br> 
 <br> 
Other fish species captured during the survey include yellow bullhead, black bullhead, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, and largemouth bass. <br>

 Lake Clarity = '' 
 Narrative = '<p>Net Lake is a 136-acre lake of moderate fertility.  The lake is located east of the town of Nickerson on the boarder of Pine and Carlton Counties within the Nemadji State Forest Area.  The immediate shoreline surrounding Net Lake is composed of lake homes and seasonal cabins along the west/northwest shore while marshland and undeveloped forest or woodland make up the remaining shoreline.  The surrounding Nemadji River watershed is primarily undeveloped forest or woodland, marshland, and some bog land.  The shore is predominately sand and water clarity is pretty good with secchi readings over 6 feet.  Net Lake is considered a low priority lake because of its small size, lack of public access, and self sustaining gamefish population.  Past management has included some walleye stocking, but this has not occurred since 1983 due to the lack of a public access.  Currently, the primary management species are northern pike and walleye with largemouth bass, bluegill sunfish, and black crappie as the secondary management species.  A population assessment was conducted during August of 2005 to determine the current status of the fish population.  Evaluation of the fish population utilized spring night electrofishing for largemouth bass, gill nets, trap nets, and shoreline seining.  Northern pike numbers and  size were at normal levels for lakes of this type.  Northerns averaged 2.9 pounds with half the catch exceeding 22 inches.  When compared to the 2000 sample, northern pike abundance and size has increased.  Largemouth bass were sampled at a rate of 9 per hour, very similar to the 2000 rate.  While bass abundance appears to be low quality sized fish were found.  Only one bass was less than 14 inches in length.  Bluegill and black crappie abundance along with their average sizes were typical for the lake type and fairly similar to past assessments.  Both were on the small side.  Few crappie reached 8 inches while less than 20% of the bluegill catch was over 6 inches.  Yellow perch numbers were found at low abundance levels.  According to previous surveys dating back to 1955, low perch abundance has been common except for 1977.  Shoreline seining efforts found good reproductive success for bluegill, black crappie, and largemouth bass.  The fish community in Net Lake was also made up of golden shiner, pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, and white sucker.  White sucker were high in abundance but small enough to provide forage for both bass and northerns.Anglers seeking a peaceful, relaxing fishing experience with the possibility of catching a quality sized northern pike or largemouth bass may want to visit Net Lake.  A fair number of smaller bluegill sunfish and black crappie could also be encountered.  Since Net Lake does not have a public access, fishing enthusiasts will have to obtain permission from a private land owner to gain access to this lake.  Anglers are encouraged to be selective when they harvest fish by keeping the smaller ones for eating and releasing the larger ones.  Releasing larger fish will help maintain or enhance the quality of the fish population and provide future angling opportunities for others.  Land owners within the surrounding watershed and lakeshore property owners can maintain the current good water quality of Net Lake by protecting or re-establishing buffer strips along the shoreline of the lake with native plants, updating failing or outdated septic systems, using only phosphorus free fertilizer (if needed) on lawns and  gardens, limiting aquatic plant removel or disturbance, and limiting construction of impervious surfaces near the shoreline.</p>'

In recent years Walleye, the primary management species, have been stocked annually as fingerlings at a rate of 1.5 pounds per littoral acre (300 pounds).  A paved public access and a private resort are both located on the south shore of the lake.  The lake is fairly remote with moderate levels of development.  The shoreline is predominately sand and the water clarity is fairly good despite occasional algae blooms.  Lake use is light to moderate for both boating and fishing.  Anglers can expect acceptable-size Black Crappie, Walleye, and Largemouth Bass in abundances typical of the lake type.   <br> 
 <br> 
To assess lake management goals and the current fishery, an assessment was conducted on Oak Lake in 2015.  This survey consisted of night electrofishing, gill netting, and trap netting.   <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye, Yellow Perch, Black Crappie, and Bluegill were all present in size and numbers typical of the lake type.  Black Crappie again averaged close to 8 inches with individuals over 10 inches present.  Walleye averaged 17 inches and nearly two pounds.  Largemouth Bass increased in both size and abundance compared to the previous assessment.  Bass averaged over 13 inches and a pound-and-a-third.  The Northern Pike quality dipped since the 2010 netting when more than a fifth of the catch exceeded 30 inches.  Only one northern in the 2015 assessment exceeded 30 inches.   <br>

 Lake Clarity = '' 
 Narrative = '<p>Passenger Lake, a 70 acre lake of low fertility, is located  southeast of the town of Sturgeon Lake in northern Pine County.  Eighty-three percent of the lake is dominated by water depths less than or equal to 15 feet with a small area of deeper water towards the northwest end of the lake.  Despite an abundant amount of shallow water acreage, a fish winterkill of any degree has never been documented by the Hinckley DNR Fisheries Office.  The shoreline around the lake margin is moderately developed along the west/northwest shore and east/southeast shore while the remaining shoreline is composed of mostly mixed hardwood forest with some conifers and marshland.  Past management has consisted of an initial survey in 1955 followed by resurveys in 1967 and 1984, a fish house count in 1987, and some scattered fish stocking efforts during the first half of the twentieth century.  The current management plan lists northern pike as the primary management species with largemouth bass, bluegill sunfish, and black crappie as the secondary management species.  This plan also calls for a resurvey as per a ten year schedule.  Based on this schedule, a resurvey should have occurred in 1994.  However, due to time contraints and low priority status, the evaluation was postponed until adequate time became available.  Passenger Lake is considered a low priority lake because of its small size, lack of public access, and self sustaining gamefish population.  The Area Fisheries Office has determined that a fish population assessment utilizing gill and trap nets followed by shoreline seining would be sufficient sampling for the next evaluation.  Revision of the current management plan to a fifteen or twenty year assessment schedule may be a reasonable goal for the future.A fish population assessment was conducted during the week of June 12, 2000 to evaluate the current status of the fish population in Passenger Lake.  Standard water quality parameters were also measured.  Gill nets, trap nets, and late summer shoreline seining were the selected fish sampling gear types.  Northern pike numbers were below normal for this lake type along with an average weight of 1.1 pounds.  Measurd northern ranged from 15.2 to 20.4 inches.  Historically, pike abundance has been low and size small.  Previous surveys sampled young-of-the-year largemouth bass which indicated the presence of mature adult fish.  During this assessment a single 13.7 inch largemouth bass that weighed 1.4 pounds was captured.  Since spring night electrofishing has never been used to target largemouth in the past, future management plans should include this sampling gear as part of the next assessment.  Bluegill sunfish and black crappie abundance and average size were found to be normal.  Total lengths of bluegill extended from 2.8 to 8.8 inches with an average length of 5.9 inches.  All lengths were well represented and a good number of sunfish were between 7.0 to 8.0 inches.  Crappie measured from 5.0 to just under 12.0 inches, but numbers of larger fish (>9.0 inches) were sparse.  The fish population in Passenger Lake was also composed of black, brown, and yellow bullhead, johnny darter, pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow perch, walleye, and white sucker.  DNR Fisheries surveys have never sampled walleye in the past.  A 24.8 inch walleye that weighed 5.8 pounds was captured during the 2000 assessment.  Historical stocking records indicate that walleye fry were stocked at some point between 1917 and 1943 while walleye fingerlings were stocked in 1949 and 1952.  Fisheries personnel assumed that stocking success was null because subsequent DNR surveys did not capture walleye.  It is unlikely that the recent sample of walleye resulted from these stocking efforts, but rather from the lakes eventual connection to the Willow River which has a resident walleye popultion or an unauthorized private stocking.  Pumpkinseed sunfish, yellow bullhead, yellow perch, and white sucker were found at normal abundance levels while black and brown bullhead were below normal in number.  Good natural reproduction was found for bluegill sunfish and some success for largemouth bass and pumpkinseed sunfish.Water recreation enthusiasts will have to obtain permission from shoreline property owners to gain access to Passenger Lake.  The lake has historically been known for fair sized panfish.  Local lakeshore property owners reported a concern in regards to a decrease in the number and size of panfish, but based on recent assessment findings anglers are still likely to find a fair abundance of bluegill sunfish and black crappie.  The quality of fish size has decreased for crappie, but a good number of 7.0 to 8.0 inch bluegill are avialable for an angling thrill.  Selective harvest of smaller fish for eating and release of the larger ones is encouraged.  Releasing the larger fish will help maintain or improve the current quality of the fish population and provide future angling opportunities for others who would like to experience catching a quality sized fish.  Since land uses within a watershed surrounding a lake influence the lakes water quality, additional nutrient input may decrease this lakes water quality and ultimately its overall health.  Shoreline property owners and surrounding watershed land users can maintain water quality by protecting the existing abundance of natural shoreline, developing a shoreline buffer zone of native plants species along developed shorelines, updating outdated or failing septic systems, using phosphorus free fertilizer (if needed) on surrounding lawns, gardens, or crop land, utilizing crop farming practices that reduce run-off, limiting aquatic plant removal or disturbance, and limiting construction of impervious surfaces near the shoreline.</p>'

 Narrative = '<p>Pokegama Lake is a very fertile, highly developed 1,474 acre basin located near Pine City.  Despite having an abundance of shallow water acreage (61% at 15 feet or less), the lake has not experienced a major summer or winter fish kill in many years.  Nuisance algae blooms are common in summer due to phosphorus loading from the watershed, the lake margin, lake sediments and direct precipitation.  This nutrient load can cause dense algae blooms which limit aquatic plant abundance.  The shoreline is predominately sand with public access available on both the north and south shore.  Management is primarily for Walleye and Northern Pike.  Walleye stocking ceased from 1991 until 2000, when annual fry stocking was initiated.  Fry stocking was discontinued in 2004 when fall fingerling stocking resumed.  Walleye fingerlings (903 pounds) are now stocked annually.  <br> 
 <br> 
A lake population assessment was conducted during July of 2014 to evaluate the current status of the fish population and lake management goals.  Based on the gillnet catch, Walleye were below normal for lakes of this type in both their number and average size.  Trapnets are not usually the gear of choice for assessing Walleye, however they captured notably larger Walleye during the 2014 assessment of Pokegama Lake.  Lengths of captured Walleye from the two gear types combined ranged from 7.3 to 25.3 inches.  Of the Walleye aged, most were 3 year olds from the 2011 year-class.  The Northern Pike numbers have decreased each assessment since 2000 and were below the normal range for the lake class. Northern Pike from gillnets and trapnets combined averaged 4.4 pounds and ranged from 9.8 to 37.2 inches.  Black Crappie numbers remain good with most larger than 9 inches.  White Crappie were far less abundant but can still add to the crappie catch.  Channel Catfish were less numerous than in the previous assessment but slightly larger averaging just over 22 inches and 4 pounds.  Channel Catfish provide a different opportunity that some anglers may enjoy.  Compared to similar lakes, Bluegill Sunfish were typical in abundance but larger in size.  Most Bluegills sampled exceeded 7.5 inches in length with 30% of the catch 8 inches or better.  Yellow Perch, an important food source for Walleye and Northern Pike, were again low in number.  Half the perch catch exceeded 8 inches, providing at least a bonus to panfish anglers.  The fish community also included Yellow Bullhead, Bowfin (Dogfish), Chestnut Lamprey, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum (Sheephead), Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Shorthead Redhorse, Silver Redhorse, White Sucker, Lake Sturgeon, Bigmouth Buffalo, Quillback, and White Bass.   <br> 
 <br> 
Fishing pressure is generally moderate but, along with pleasure boaters, lake use can be high.  Anglers are likely to encounter a few quality sized Walleye, Northern Pike, or Channel Catfish.  Black Crappie and Bluegill should provide good fishing for panfish enthusiasts with an occasional White Crappie or Yellow Perch.  The current management goals set for Pokegama Lake are to maintain a Walleye population between 1.5 and 4.0 per gill net lift with an average weight ranging from 1.0 to 2.0 pounds, a Northern Pike catch rate somewhere between 2.0 and 3.0 per gill net lift, and to control the Freshwater Drum population to less than 15.0 per gill net lift through commercial removal.  The 2014 assessment found Walleye and Northern Pike abundance below the desired range while the management goal was met for Freshwater Drum.</p>'

 Narrative = '<p>Big Tamarack is a small, clear lake with low fertility located in eastern Pine County. The lake is managed for Northern Pike and Bluegill. A voluntary catch and release program has been initiated by the lake association. A public access is located on the southwest end of the lake. Fishing pressure is usually light. <br> 
 <br> 
Although this survey found the fewest Northern Pike in the lake's survey history (4.5 fish per gill net), they are still at a level typical for this type of lake. Average size increased somewhat from the previous survey, 1.7 to 2.2 pounds, also typical for this type of lake. Growth is fairly slow though and the largest fish sampled was just under 29 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill catch rates have historically been high in this lake and that held true for this survey. As is typical for lakes with very abundant Bluegill, the size of fish is not especially large. Fish averaged 5.4 inches in length and the largest fish sampled measured 8.1 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Black Crappie numbers increased from the last survey to 2.9 per trap net, which is average for this type of lake and the highest since 1991. The size distribution of fish was typical of decent crappie lakes with fish averaging 8 inches and fish up to 10 inches present. As long as the population holds steady or continues to grow, it may provide and angling opportunity that was not available in the recent past.  <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth Bass were sampled via electrofishing at the highest rate since electrofishing began on the lake. Eighty-three fish were sampled per hour of shocking. Average length was 12.3 inches with the largest fish measuring just over 19.5 inches. The vast majority of bass are near the average with all but 6 fish sampled measuring between 9 and 16 inches.  <br>

Substrates are predominately sand and silt with an adequate abundance of aquatic vegetation.  Shoreline development on Lake Twelve has increased to 29 homes.  A public access does not exist on Lake Twelve and all of the surrounding property is privately held.            A fisheries population assessment was conducted which included trapnetting and gillnetting on June 28th and June 29th and shoreline seining on September 7th, 2000.  Previous assessments were conducted in 1967 and 1984.          Northern pike were present in moderate abundance.  Northerns ranged in length from 10.2 to 45.5 inches and in age from 2 to 10 years.  Young northern pike were not present in the seine haul.  Good spawning habitat is present in the south end of the lake but overall the availability is only fair.  Northern pike were stocked as yearlings in 1966, the only stocking on record.          Black crappie were taken in the trapnets at a rate higher than normal for the lake type but below both previous catches.  Sampled crappie varied from 4.7 to 10.0 inches with 30% of the catch greater than 7 inches.  Crappie ranged in age from 2 to 11 years with the 1998 year class representing 55% of the catch.  The 321 fingerlings sampled in the seine hauls had a 1.6 inch average.          The trapnet catch of bluegill was in the normal range for the lake class.  Bluegill averaged 5.8 inches in length with more than half the catch being greater than 6.5 inches.  The average weight was 0.21 pounds.  Bluegill ranged in age from 1 to 10 years with the strongest year classes occurring in 1996 and 1998.  Young sunfish dominated the shoreline seining and averaged 1.3 inches.          Young of the year Largemouth bass were well represented in the shoreline seining.  Adult bass were not sampled in either the trapnets or gillnets, but 3 were caught in the seine hauls.  Night electrofishing was not conducted during the assessment.           Yellow perch were abundant in the netting but were not present in the seining.  All yellow perch were between 5.3 and 7.6 inches with a 6 inch average.           Other species present during the assessment were;  golden shiner, emerald shiner, white sucker, tadpole madtom, black bullhead, yellow bullhead, pumpkinseed, and painted turtle.             Lake Twelve is fairly developed for its size and has no designated public access.  Fishing pressure is light.  Anglers should expect good numbers of acceptable size bluegill and black crappies.  Northern pike, while not overly abundant, provide a trophy fishery with lengths of some individuals exceeding 45 inches. </p>'

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/16/2014 Clarity: 5.9' 
 Narrative = '<p>Cross Lake is a southeastern Polk County lake with a history of algal blooms and good fishing in between winterkills.  Northern Pike, Brown Bullhead, and Walleye have historically been the primary species sought by anglers.  Before the most recent series of severe winterkills in 1988, 1990, and 1991, anglers on the fishing pier were catching two to four pound Walleyes and one to two pound Brown Bullheads quite regularly.  However, the 1991 winterkill eliminated nearly every species but bullheads, and even bullhead numbers were severely decreased. <br> 
 <br> 
Nine years later, in 2000, Northern Pike rebounded to abundances that were more normal for this lake.  Now, in 2014, the catch rate has increased even more and, in 2014, the catch rate was well above normal for this lake.  Pike sampled by all gears ranged from 9.9 to 37.2 inches in length with an average of 21.8 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye fry are stocked regularly and test net catches were strong in 2014.  Cross Lake Walleyes grow quickly and sampled fish averaged over two pounds each.  Five distinct year classes of Walleye were found, but the strongest was the 2011.  Those young fish should provide good angling in the near future if they do not succumb to winterkill.  Fry stocking appears to work best when bullhead numbers are down, as is currently the case. <br> 
 <br> 
Although Bluegill and Black Crappie populations cannot be classified as abundant, record catch rates of Bluegills and Black Crappies were found in 2014.  There were good sized fish of both species present and, even though many were young, they should also provide good fishing in the near future barring severe winterkill. <br> 
 <br> 
Bullhead numbers were down markedly in 2014.  Brown Bullheads were slightly more abundant and larger than Black Bullheads.  High numbers of bullheads are typical for lakes subject to winterkill since these species are most tolerant of low dissolved oxygen.  They tend to rebound quickly following winterkill since there are few competitors or predators.  However, after several years without winterkill, game fish species can often overtake the bullhead populations.  This appears to be happening in Cross Lake. <br> 
 <br> 
In the past, the Fosston Community Sportsmen's Club and the Fosston Lion's Club operated aeration equipment in efforts to prevent winterkill from occurring in Cross Lake.  A heavy winterkill in 1988 eliminated gamefish populations from the lake, even with aeration systems operating.  Although no severe winterkill has occurred since 1991, light kills took place in 2001, 2004, and 2006.  In addition, dissolved oxygen levels reached the critical mark in 2014, but no evidence of fish kill was found. <br> 
 <br> 
It is clear from historical data that Cross Lake is ecologically suited for Northern Pike and bullhead.  Although periodic winterkills have occasionally reduced or eliminated many fish populations, these species remain most abundant and able to sustain themselves.  Walleye and panfish stocking following winterkills has provided additional fishing opportunities in Cross Lake.</p>'

 Narrative = '<p>Hill River Lake has undergone three documented periods of severe winterkill.  The first was during the drought in the 1930's.  A dam was constructed at the outlet in 1935 and reconstructed in 1950 in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent winterkill by raising water levels.  More recently, the dam was reconstructed during road reconstruction.  The second recorded period of winterkill, during winters of 1969 through 1971, was attributed to runoff from a large poultry farm.  The third period, during the mid 1990's, decimated populations of Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, Bluegills, and Black Crappies.  Although the lake has a 60 foot maximum depth, much of the lake is considerably shallower.  The lake is also relatively fertile and experiences heavy blue-green algal blooms annually. <br> 
 <br> 
Eighteen years after the most recent severe winterkill, however, fisheries for pike, bass,  and panfish have substantially recovered while bullhead populations have declined dramatically.  Modest populations of Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass were sampled in 2014 while net catches of Bluegill and Black Crappie were very strong.  Bluegills and crappies were relatively young and relatively small averaging 5.8 and 6.1 inches in length, respectively.  The abundance of young panfish in 2014 may bode well for panfish angling opportunities in the near future, barring a winterkill.</p>'

 Narrative = '<p>Maple Lake has a good fishery for gamefish and panfish despite heavy development, heavy use, algal blooms, and occasional low dissolved oxygen levels during winter.  No severe winterkill has occurred for many years, and with the exception of walleye, fish populations have generally sustained themselves.  Little natural reproduction of walleye exists and stocking is required to maintain the population in Maple Lake.  Two aeration units operated by the Maple Lake Improvement District are used almost annually during the winter months in an attempt to prevent winterkill of fish species. <br> 
 <br> 
The Walleye gill net catch rate in Maple Lake averaged 6.1 per set in 2015, which is near the lake's historical average of 6.3 per set.  Total lengths of sampled Walleyes ranged from 7.4 to 28.6 inches with an average length of 17.1 inches.  There was a wide range of sizes and ages present with 16 different year classes found.  This was not surprising, as Maple Lake is annually stocked with Walleye fingerlings in the fall.  <br> 
 <br> 
The Northern Pike gill net catch rate of 15.0 pike per net was nearly double the normal range of similar lakes.  The average Northern Pike length of 23.5 inches was larger than all those reported in the nine previous DNR studies on Maple Lake.  Lengths of sampled Northern Pike ranged from 11.4 to 34.7 inches.  Northern Pike had an average weight of 2.9 pounds.   <br> 
 <br> 
The Bluegill trap net catch rate was 112 per set in 2015, which was nearly four times the lake's historic average of 29.3 Bluegills per set and well above the normal range for other similar lakes across the state.  The average length of sampled Bluegill was 6.7 inches and lengths ranged from 3.5 to 9.6 inches.  Three-year-old and four-year-old Bluegills were the most abundant in the sample. <br> 
 <br> 
Spring electrofishing was conducted as another method to evaluate the Largemouth Bass and Black Crappie populations.  Largemouth Bass caught by electrofishing ranged in size from 4.3 to 17.7 inches with an average length of 9.8 inches.  Black Crappie caught by electrofishing ranged in size from 5.6 to 11.7 inches and had an average length of 8.8 inches.  Trap net catches also sampled similar sized Black Crappie, but abundance was below the historical lake average.  Only 3.2 Black Crappies per trap net were captured during this survey compared to the historical lake average of 14.2 per trap net.  All but two of the 45 crappies sampled were of the 2009 year class or younger.  <br> 
 <br> 
Other lakes in the state similar to Maple Lake are typically known for their abundance of bullheads. Maple Lake at one time was no exception.  However in recent surveys the bullhead numbers have been much lower.  Similarly, while Common Carp are particularly noticeable to lake dwellers during summer spawning, the 2015 numbers were at a historic low with only one carp was captured. <br> 
 <br> 
To protect water quality, lake habitat, and good fishing, watershed residents should follow practices outlined in the DNR publication "Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality" when landscaping shoreline property.  Property owners should not fertilize or should use phosphorus free fertilizers, leave aquatic vegetation intact (especially emergent vegetation like bulrush and cattail), and leave natural vegetation buffers on shoreland lots.  These buffers reduce nutrient and sediment input and control erosion.  These actions can help slow down the natural aging process and reduce the chance for winterkill.  </p>'

 Narrative = '<p>Lake Sarah is a small (366 acres), eutrophic, Polk County lake that is prone to substantial water level changes. Some of the most drastic fish catch rate fluctuations coincided with the drought in the late 1980s and early 1990s when emergent vegetation was stranded above the shoreline and submerged vegetation decreased. Water levels were low again during the summer survey in 2016.  <br> 
 <br> 
Walleyes were introduced in Lake Sarah in 1974, and fry are currently stocked every other year. In 2016, the Walleye gill net catch rate was extremely high (24.3 fish per net) and over twice the historical average. Mean Walleye length was 17.5 inches and size ranged from 9.5 to 27.2 inches. The 1986 survey, which occurred during the previous period of low water, also had a similarly high Walleye gill net catch rate (26.3 fish per net).  <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike gill net catch rate was also high at 23.5 fish per net. This catch rate is over twice the historical mean and well above what is expected for similar lakes. Average length of gill netted Northern Pike was 22.0 inches and ranged from 15.9 to 32.8.  <br> 
 <br> 
Although Yellow Perch were present, gill net catch rate remained lower than the lake's historical average (21.4 fish per net) at 5.7 per net. The average length of sampled perch was 6.2 inches and size ranged from 5.6 to 7.0 inches.  <br>

Trap net catch was 10.7 Bluegills per net, nearly equal to the lake's historical average and within what is expected for similar lakes. The mean length of sampled Bluegills was 6.9 inches and lengths ranged from 2.9 to 9.7 inches.  <br>

Trap net catch of Black Crappies increased to a historic high of 5.2 fish per net. Black Crappie length ranged from 8.1 to 12.6 inches with an average of 9.2 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth Bass have only been present in trap nets in three of the nine Fisheries surveys conducted on Lake Sarah. A single 16.9 inch bass was sampled by trap net in 2016, and fourteen were captured electrofishing. Electrofished bass ranged from 10.7 to 17.8 inches with a mean of 14.5 inches. </p>'

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/11/2014 Clarity: 8' 
 Narrative = '<p>Spring Lake is a small lake that supports a native bass, panfish, and pike community along with a few Walleyes.  Results of the 2014 lake assessment indicate that the lake holds fair numbers of panfish such as Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Yellow Perch.  Predatory fish like Northern Pike, Walleye and Largemouth Bass are also present although they are naturally not as abundant as their prey.  Pike numbers were up in 2014 and the average size was good, as well, with a mean length of 24.4 inches and mean weight of 3.3 pounds.  The modest Walleye fishery is sustained by stocking since Walleye do not reproduce naturally in this lake due to the lack of acceptable spawning and rearing habitat. <br> 
 <br> 
Even with good growth rates, in a small lake like Spring moderate amounts of fishing pressure can keep the average sizes of fish small unless anglers release a portion of the larger fish back into the lake.  Due to its location in an area with fewer permanent fishing lakes, Spring Lake receives a moderate or higher amount of angling pressure.  The lake's size and proximity to the city of Lengby make input of sediment and nutrients from human activities a concern.  Although the lakeshore is not as heavily developed as those of many larger lakes, a 134-acre lake like Spring cannot sustain large nutrient loads without experiencing algal blooms and other symptoms of nutrient enrichment.  Watershed residents need to be aware that what they do on their lands may affect water quality in the lake.  Maintaining or improving the lake's current water quality and habitat conditions can benefit all users of this lake.</p>'

 Survey Date = '2009-08-03',  County Name = 'Polk', Lake Name = 'Store' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/03/2009 Clarity: 4' 
 Narrative = '<p>Store (Peterson) Lake is a 52-acre, eutrophic lake in eastern Polk county that is currently vulnerable to winterkill.  The lake and its fish community have undergone dramatic changes since it was first surveyed in 1983.  At the time of the 1983 survey, Store was not considered a winterkill lake.  Water clarity was good and it contained a diverse and well-structured fish community, not typical of a lake that experiences frequent periods of low dissolved oxygen levels. <br> 
 <br> 
Store Lake experienced a severe winterkill in the winter of 1993-1994.  This winterkill was likely the result of lower water levels during that time period and increased nutrient loading from the surrounding watershed.  Some illegal ditching activity that occurred in the mid-1980s probably contributed to these conditions.  The illegal inlet and outlet ditches were subsequently plugged, but apparently not before severe damage was done.  Only fish species tolerant of low oxygen conditions, such as bullheads, golden shiners, and yellow perch were captured during the 1994 survey. <br> 
 <br> 
Test netting in 2009 showed that Store Lake now supports modest walleye and northern pike fisheries.  Brown bullheads remained the most abundant species, but numbers have declined considerably in the past decade.  Walleyes stocked as fry in 2004 were nearly as abundant as bullheads in 2009 and the average walleye size was a very acceptable 17.7 inches and 1.7 pounds. <br> 
 <br> 
The highly variable fishery in Store Lake is a direct reflection of the decline in water quality and post-winterkill stocking.  Water transparency has decreased from 12 feet in 1983 to four feet in 1999 and 2009, while phosphorus levels and nuisance algal blooms have increased.  Prior to the degradation of water quality, this lake provided a popular fishery for abundant bluegills and large northern pike.  Efforts to restore the northern pike and panfish populations will likely be ineffective unless trends in declining water quality can be reversed and the possibility of winterkill decreased.  The history of this lake serves as a lesson that activities in a watershed can have drastic effects on lakes and their fish populations.  Things that riparian owners and other watershed dwellers can do to protect water quality and fish populations include: (1) leaving wide shoreline buffer zones of unmowed vegetation, (2) leaving aquatic vegetation stands intact, especially bulrush and cattail, (3) participating in a Soil and Water Conservation District or Minnesota Pollution Control Agency Citizen Lake Monitoring Program, and (4) acquiring DNR permits for aquatic plant removal and shoreline alterations.</p>'

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/30/2012 Clarity: 8' 
 Narrative = '<p>Union Lake continues to support a diverse fishery with several popular fish species including walleye, northern pike, black crappie, largemouth bass, and bluegill.  Most of these species naturally reproduce in Union Lake, despite water level fluctuations, shoreline development, aquatic vegetation removal, and fishing pressure.  The lake's walleye population has generally required stocking to sustain the fishery, although some natural reproduction has occurred recently. <br> 
 <br> 
At 16.1 fish per gill net, walleye catch rates in 2012 were the highest ever recorded in this lake and two of the three most abundant year classes were attributed to natural reproduction.  It is possible that fry stocking has increased the walleye population to the point where natural reproduction can be more successful than in the past.  It is also possible that water levels were favorable for providing good walleye spawning habitat during the two successful years.  Walleyes sampled in 2012 averaged 15.2 inches in length and 1.4 pounds in weight. <br> 
 <br> 
Catch rates for northern pike, largemouth bass, and black crappie were near their historical averages for Union Lake.  Northern pike averaged 22.4 inches (about 2.4 pounds) and pike over 30 inches in length were caught in test nets.  Largemouth bass averaged 11.3 inches, but there were good ranges of size and age classes found.  Black crappies were relatively small on average (8.3 inches), but fish over 10 inches in length were not uncommon. <br> 
 <br> 
Catch rates for bluegill and yellow perch were lower than historical catches in Union Lake but similar to those of the two prior evaluations since high water levels began in the late 1990's.  As a primary forage fish for the predator fish in Union Lake, yellow perch are an important part of the fish community.  However, in 2012 northern pike and walleye growth rates remained strong compared to statewide and historical lake indices.  At an average length of 5.4 inches, bluegills were not large, but several over eight inches were sampled. <br> 
 <br> 
Eurasian watermilfoil was found in the lake in 2007.  Initial sampling during that year revealed no signs of Eurasian watermilfoil outside of Union Lake after a series of river inspections and spot checks of the watershed that meanders southwest of Union Lake to the Red River.  The primary concern is to contain the plants so they don't spread to other lakes, or downstream into the Sand Hill River to the Red River and into Manitoba, where Eurasian watermilfoil has never been found.  More monitoring will occur, with effort focused on the drainage pump located on the southwest corner of the lake, where lake water passes into the local watershed. Because of drier conditions recently, the pump has not been operating.  Boaters entering and leaving the lake are required to drain all water and check boats, trailers and equipment for vegetation and invasive species. <br> 
 <br> 
Lakeshore and watershed property owners can help to slow the aging of the lake (eutrophication) by using the best management practices available.  These practices include (1) exceeding setbacks for structures and septic systems, (2) leaving buffer strips of natural vegetation along the shoreline, (3) leaving vegetation stands (especially bulrush and cattail) intact, (4) and minimizing fertilizer and other chemical use in the watershed.</p>'

 Survey Date = '2015-08-15',  County Name = 'Polk', Lake Name = 'Whitefish' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/10/2015 Clarity: 2.9' 
 Narrative = '<p>Whitefish Lake is a eutrophic, 226-acre, class 38 lake with a maximum depth of 18 feet.  Blue-green algal blooms are common during most summers and dissolved oxygen can become low during severe winters leading to periodic winterkills.  Low winter dissolved oxygen levels were reported in 1994, 2004, 2006 and 2013.  A moderate to heavy winterkill occurred in 2004, while light winterkills may have occurred in 2006 and 2013.  Walleye fry and Black Crappie brood fish were stocked following the winterkill in 2004.  The outlet of Whitefish Lake is a tributary to the Poplar River and several fish species are able to repopulate the lake following winterkill. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike have historically been the primary gamefish species in Whitefish Lake, although their population numbers have fluctuated greatly.  The Northern Pike gill net catch rate in 2015 was 8.7 fish per net compared to the lake's historical average of 9.7 per net.  The historical high catch rate of 19.5 fish per net occurred in the previous survey in 2005.  Northern Pike sampled in gill nets in 2015 averaged 22.1 inches and 2.4 pounds.  No Northern Pike older than five years old were sampled. <br> 
 <br> 
The 2015 Walleye gill net catch rate set a historic high of 4.0 fish per net.  The next highest catch rate was 1.5 fish per net, recorded in both 1989 and 1995 assessments.  Sampled Walleyes ranged 8.6-25.6 inches in length with an average length of 19.2 inches.  The Walleye population is maintained primarily by stocking of fry in odd years, and Walleyes averaged 16.3 inches by the time they are four years old. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch are a relatively winterkill resistant species and they were found to be more abundant in Whitefish Lake than in other similar lakes in the state.  The 2015 gill net catch rate of 54.2 fish per net was near the lake average of 53.2 fish per net.  The average length of Yellow Perch was 6.8 inches and lengths ranged from 5.3-9.1 inches.   <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth Bass were present in the 1989 survey and adult Bluegills were stocked in 1990.  Black Crappies were found in several previous studies and were stocked as adult brood fish in 2004.  However, no Bluegills or Black Crappie were sampled in this survey.  One young of the year Largemouth Bass and two hybrid sunfish were captured suggesting at least some adult fish from the sunfish family are present in Whitefish Lake. <br> 
 <br> 
Black Bullheads are very abundant in Whitefish Lake.  Bullhead abundance is typically indexed with trap nets, but the 2015 trap net catch rate of Black Bullheads was 0.1 fish per net while 155.8 Black Bullheads were caught per gill net.  Black Bullheads averaged 7.6 inches in length. Comparatively, the gillnet catch of Brown Bullheads was only 0.33 fish per net. <br> 
 <br> 
Common Carp have migrated into Whitefish Lake and catch rates have fluctuated from 0.0-1.56 per net.  Only one Common Carp was captured in 2015 for a catch rate of 0.11 per trap net.  The captured Common Carp was large at 34.5 inches in length. <br> 
 <br> 
Anglers can help to maintain balance in fish populations by voluntarily releasing a portion of medium and large fish and keeping smaller ones for eating.  This is particularly true for Northern Pike and Bluegill.  Shoreline owners and other watershed dwellers can help to maintain or improve water quality and fish habitat by leaving shoreline buffer zones, by leaving stands of native aquatic vegetation intact, by taking precautions to prevent invasive species introductions, and by using wise land management practices.</p>'

 Survey Date = '2013-08-19',  County Name = 'Pope', Lake Name = 'Amelia' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/19/2013 Clarity: 6.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Lake Amelia is a 934-acre natural basin located approximately one mile southwest of the City of Villard in Pope County.  It is the lowermost basin in a chain of three lakes comprised of Leven, Villard, and Amelia lakes.  Lake Amelia is larger and much deeper than connected basins.  Maximum depth is 69.0 feet.  Average depth is 21.0 feet. <br> 
 <br> 
Lake Amelia offers a high quality environment for sustained proliferation of native gamefishes.  Upstream Leven and Villard lakes remove and assimilate nutrients and sediments delivered from a large watershed before discharged to Lake Amelia.  Water clarity approaches 12.0 feet through much of the summer.  Severe algal blooms are rare.  Bottom soils are primarily sand and gravel.  Dense stands of emergent aquatic vegetation remain along the northwest shoreline.  The lake supports a diverse submergent plant community.  In response to very good water clarity, submergent plants grow to a depth of 19 feet.     <br> 
 <br> 
Lake Amelia supports a healthy, robust fish community.  Primary fish management is focused on the walleye fishery.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked in even-numbered years to supplement inconsistent natural recruitment.  A gillnet catch rate of 16.0-walleye/net during the 2013 survey described an abundant population.  The population sample was comprised of 11 age groups.  Sizes at capture varied from 8.8 to 26.4 inches.  Average size was 15.5 inches and 1.5 pounds.   <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike are also abundant.  Reproductive success and initial survival was good in 2008 and 2009.  Sizes captured in gillnets varied from 13.2 - 28.8 inches in total length.  Due to proportionally high numbers of four- and five-year-old fish making up the population sample, average size was 19.8 inches and weighed 1.7 pounds.  Due to a limited carrying capacity and competition, pike grow slowly beyond age 4.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest the surplus pike.  <br> 
 <br> 
Fewer largemouth bass were captured during the 2013 survey than reported in preceding surveys.  Based on age distribution of electrofishing catch, declining abundance was partially attributable to loss of many old fish stemming from strong recruitment from the late-90s through 2003.  Fewer young bass have grown into the fishery since 2004.  A net reduction in bass abundance is considered desirable and will likely improve rate of growth.  The largest bass captured was estimated to be 14-years-old and measured 17.9 inches.   <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill catch was also lower during the 2013 survey, suggesting that population abundance has declined.  Warm surface water temperatures during the August survey may have pushed older fish into deeper water and reduced the effectiveness of trapnets.  Average size of bluegills caught in gillnets was larger than that of trapnets.  The population sample did have a broad age distribution extending to age 12.  In contrast to age structure of bluegills captured in preceding surveys, none of the 11 age classes represented in the 2013 population sample could be described as strong.  A reduction in recruitment of young bluegill might be attributable to poor survival due to high densities of northern pike and walleyes.  No yellow perch, a primary prey for these predators, were caught during the 2013 survey.  Young bluegills may now make up a greater proportion of pike and walleye diets.  Based on this information a net decline in population abundance is likely a reality.  The average trapnet catch rate of 8.6-bluegill/net remains within the range of expected catches for similar lakes.  The largest bluegill caught during the survey measured 8.8 inches in total length.   <br> 
 <br> 
Only 16 black crappies were captured during the 2013 survey.  Low catch rates are not unexpected during summer months.  Most crappies large enough to escape predators will occupy deeper, cooler water during the heat of the summer.  This behavioral pattern makes them less vulnerable to capture with our sampling gears.  True to expectations, all 10.0-inch and larger crappies were captured in gillnets which are set offshore.  Size at capture varied from 4.1 to 13.5 inches in total length.  <br> 
 <br> 
Failure to catch a yellow perch is cause for concern.  Catch rates were very low in the 2003 and 2008 surveys.  Adequate abundance and multiple size groups are extremely important to predator growth and fishing quality.  At a slow rate of growth, too many walleye, largemouth bass, and northern pike are lost to natural mortality before growing to large sizes.  Predators will also change their preferred diet to the young of other gamefishes.  A young walleye is an acceptable substitute of yellow perch.  Stocking performance can diminish due to poor survival of young walleye.  Again, anglers are strongly encouraged to help correct the current predator-prey imbalance by harvesting predators, particularly 14.0 to 21.0 inch northern pike. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow bullheads are abundant.  Many are large enough to harvest.  Ten-inch and larger yellow bullheads comprised 78% of bullheads captured in gillnets.  Average weight of captures was 0.7 pounds.  <br> 
 <br> 
Chinese mystery snails are present in Lake Amelia.  Other aquatic invasive species such as zebra mussels and Eurasian water milfoil have not been detected.  As required by Minnesota Statue, boaters need to clean their equipment before entering and leaving the lake to prevent spread of these undesirable organisms. <br>

 Narrative = '<p>Goose Lake is a shallow basin located five miles south of Terrace in Pope County.  Maximum depth is approximately 17.0 feet.  Winterkill events were common on Goose Lake in the past.  Water level has been increasing for many years and is evidenced by dead standing timber fringing the shoreline.  Increased depth and moderating winters has allowed establishment of a fishery following stocking of adult broodstock in 2008.  Dense algal blooms can occur during summer months.  The primitive carry-in public access consists of a steep trail approximately 200 yards to the lake. <br> 
 <br> 
An introductory stocking of adult bluegill and largemouth bass was completed in late spring of 2008.  No bluegill were sampled in 2012.  Success of largemouth bass stocking was evident in survey findings.  Five year classes were represented in the sample.  Largemouth bass are abundant.  Daytime electrofishing yielded 119.0 bass per hour.  Mean length of sampled fish was 7.7 inches.  The largest individual measured 16.6 inches.  Growth is rapid.  Age-4 fish reached 15.0 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Also present in the fishery are black bullheads, green sunfish and white suckers.  Increasing gamefish density has reduced recruitment and abundance of black bullheadsand green sunfish. <br>

Most of the western half of the lake is five feet in depth or less and heavily vegetated.  Most shoreline development, fishing, and other surface water uses occur in the deeper, eastern half of the lake.   Maximum depth of the lake is 31.0.  Mean depth of the open water area of the lake is approximately 10.0 ft.   Water clarity can vary greatly depending upon weather patterns and volume of runoff, but averages approximately 7.0 ft. during summer months.   <br> 
 <br> 
Grove Lake supports self-sustaining populations of largemouth bass, bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfishes, northern pike, and black crappie.  Walleyes are stocked to round out fishing opportunities. <br> 
 <br> 
Recent survey findings describe a moderately abundant bluegill population.   Bluegills grow well and offer high quality fishing experiences.  The largest bluegill captured during the 2012 survey was 9.7 inches in length.  Fourteen percent of bluegill measured exceeded 8.0 inches.  A strong year class of four-year-old bluegills will enhance harvestable numbers and sustain quality fishing for several years.  Largemouth bass and black crappie catches were unexpectedly low.  Most captures proved to be young fish.   Average length of black crappies caught was 7.3 inches.  The largest bass measured were captured in trapnets.  Survey results for largemouth bass and black crappie catches were not considered representative of the existing population.   <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike are overly abundant.  Anglers are encouraged to take advantage of this surplus and harvest more pike.  Based on 2012 survey information, northern pike are over-exploiting the yellow perch population as prey and may also be limiting survival of stocked walleyes.   Pike captures ranged from 13.0 to 30.5 inches in length.  <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye fingerlings are stocked during odd-numbered years.  Returns from stocking have not met expectations.  Gillnet catches during the 2012 survey averaged 2.5 walleye/net.  Walleye are not abundant, but this popular fish grows fast and can grow to 16.0 inches in length in four years.  A high percentage of walleyes measured during the 2012 survey exceeded 20.0 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Based on survey findings, Grove Lake can provide quality fishing experiences.  Harvest pressure is moderately light.  Its a good choice for quiet, family fishing outtings. <br>

 Narrative = '<p>Lake Johanna is a shallow prairie lake located in southeastern Pope County.  The lake is comprised of two basins having a combined surface area of 1,584 acres.  The main basin has a maximum depth of 13 feet.  Water quality and clarity can be poor during summer months in response to wind and wave-induced re-suspension of sediments and subsequent algal blooms.  Water transparency exceeded 10.0 feet at time of the June 2016 survey.  With exception of a dense curly-leaf pondweed stand during early summer months, aquatic vegetation coverage and densities can be considered "moderate".  Fish community structure and fishing quality are influenced by occasional winterkill events.   <br> 
 <br> 
A standard survey was conducted in 2016 to assess the current fish community.  A partial winterkill event in the winter of 2013-2014 may have claimed some of the older, larger fish in the population.  However, as is the case in many winterkill situations, fish growth remains fast and the fishery should recover quickly.  Compared to other gamefish in Lake Johanna, Northern Pike are more tolerant of winterkill conditions and thus proved to be very abundant.  Mean length was almost 24 inches.  Several pike over 30 inches were also recorded in the catch.  Walleye catch rates declined during 2016, but a modest Walleye fishery still remains in response to supplemental fry stockings and some natural recruitment.  Largemouth Bass and Bluegill were abundant, but most captures were smaller, younger individuals.  Average length of Largemouth Bass was only 7 inches.  A few older fish up to 19 inches in total length were observed.  Most Bluegills were less than 6 inches long, however, a modest number of memorable-size fish measuring up to 11 inches were caught during the survey.  Black Crappie catch rates remained low, but crappie are not always sampled efficiently during summer surveys.  Bullhead abundance has remained well below historic levels during the last few surveys.  As long as no severe winterkills occur during the next few years, Lake Johanna should provide excellent angling opportunities. <br> 
 <br> 
Water clarity in the winter months is typically very high.  With an elevated density of Northern Pike in the lake, winter spearing opportunities should be good. <br> 
 <br> 
The Lake Johanna Scientific and Natural Area (SNA) is located in the southern basin of Lake Johanna.  This SNA is a unique island that is home to one of the largest and most diverse nesting colonies for colonial waterbirds (great blue herons, double-crested cormorants, great egrets, black-crowned night herons, and American white pelicans) in Minnesota.  The SNA is designated as a public use unit and is open to the public for nature observation and general educational and research activities.  However, it is closed to the public from April 1 through July 15 to avoid disturbance during the potential nesting season.  <br>

The basins are located within the headwaters of the East Branch of the Chippewa River in northeast Pope County.  Judicial Ditch 4, which drains a mostly agricultural watershed of approximately 8,500 acres, enters into the northeast side of Leven Lake.  This drainage has likely contributed significant amounts of nutrient and sediment to the lake and has negatively impacted water quality.  Water quality indices rank in the bottom third of 18 recreational lakes monitored by the Pope County Coalition of Lake Associations.  <br>

Emergent aquatic vegetation is abundant along the western shoreline and near the public access.  Aquatic plants provide critical spawning and cover habitat for many fish species.  These areas need to be protected from shoreline alterations associated with residential development. <br> 
 <br> 
The fish community in Leven Lake is typical of a small, eutrophic lake in west-central Minnesota.  Northern pike, bluegill and largemouth bass provide most of the fishing opportunities.  Northern pike are abundant.  Almost one-half of the fish captured in gillnets exceeded 21.0 inches in length.  The largest northern pike measured 32.1 inches.  Bluegill are also abundandt, but average size is small.  Most of the fish captured were between five and seven inches in length.  Largemouth bass are present in moderate numbers.

Parking space at the northeast access off State Highway 29 is limited. <br> 
 <br> 
Lake Reno is now designated as an infested waterbody because zebra mussels are present in Maple Lake, which is connected to Lake Reno.  Zebra mussels were first confirmed in Maple Lake in 2013.  Regulations restricting bait harvest and transport of water apply to this basin.  For more information regarding aquatic invasive species in Minnesota see the following: http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/aquatic/index.html <br> 
  <br> 
Lake Reno is well known for its high-quality Walleye fishery.  Catch statistics from the 2014 survey described a healthy Walleye population.  Walleye are abundant in response to natural recruitment and supplemental walleye fry stockings.  Gillnet catches exceeded 18.0 fish/net.  Mean size was 17.9 inches and 2.2 pounds.  Approximately 90% of gill net captures exceeded 15.0 inches and more than 25% exceeded 20.0 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Sustaining such high densities of Walleye and acceptable growth rates necessitates existence of a stable, high-quality prey base.  Yellow Perch fulfill that need.  Walleye fishing success has, at times, been only fair due to an excessive abundance of small Yellow Perch, a preferred food item.  Yellow Perch abundance has declined in recent years, but survey catch rates remain relatively good and higher than that of many other lakes within the Glenwood Management Area.  Fair numbers of harvestable-sized fish are present in the lake. <br> 
 <br> 
Other gamefishes commonly targeted by anglers include Bluegill, Black Crappie, Largemouth Bass, and Northern Pike.  Bluegill, Black Crappie, and Largemouth Bass populations have expanded through the 2000s in probable response to improving habitat conditions and increasing coverage of aquatic vegetation.  Annual recruitment inconsistencies strongly influence fishing success and quality among years, but the expanded diversity of fishing opportunities has been very welcome.  Due to fast growth of members of the sunfish family, fishing quality can be good.  Bluegill exceeding 8.0 inches, Black Crappie exceeding 10.0 inches, and Largemouth Bass exceeding 15.0 inches are relatively common.  Progressively much more angling effort is now directed at these species.  Smallmouth Bass are also expanding in Lake Reno.  Anglers reported catches of Smallmouth Bass prior to the 2014 survey, but 2014 was the first year this species was captured during a MN DNR lake survey.  <br> 
 <br> 
A low-density Northern Pike population exists in Lake Reno.  Size of captures during the 2014 survey ranged from 16.3 inches to 35.7 inches.  Pike catches averaged 22.6 inches and 2.7 pounds.  <br> 
  <br> 
Lake Reno also supports a harvestable surplus of bullheads.  Black, Brown, and Yellow Bullheads are all present in Lake Reno.  Size structure of these populations is impressive.  Most bullheads caught in survey nets exceeded 12.0 inches.  The current state record Black Bullhead came from Lake Reno back in 1997.  <br> 
 <br> 
Other fish species sampled during the 2014 survey include Bowfin (Dogfish), Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed, Rock Bass, and White Sucker.  The next lake survey is tentatively scheduled for 2018. <br> 
 <br> 
Lake Reno is a popular destination for many anglers and fishing pressure can be heavy at times, during both open water and winter seasons.  To help maintain quality of this fishery, anglers are encouraged to practice selective harvest.  Selective harvest encourages the release of larger fish while promoting harvest of the more abundant smaller fish for eating.  Releasing medium to large fish will ensure that the lake will have enough spawning age fish and should provide anglers with opportunities to catch more large fish in future fishing trips.  <br>

 Survey Date = '2013-07-15',  County Name = 'Pope', Lake Name = 'Villard' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/15/2013 Clarity: 5.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Villard Lake is a shallow, 544-acre basin located in northeastern Pope County, immediately west of the City of Villard.  The lake is the middle basin making up a connected chain of three basins that include Leven, Villard, and Amelia lakes.  Dependent upon frequency and severity of precipitation events, water quality can be seasonally impacted from excessive nutrient loading from a large, well-drained watershed.   Maximum depth is 16.0 feet.  Average depth is 10.0 feet.  Due to shallowness of the basin, strong winds and waves can re-suspend nutrients and trigger temporary algal blooms after storm events.  Water transparency during summer months averages 5.9 feet.   <br> 
 <br> 
Despite seasonal water quality impairments, Villard Lake supports all common game fishes and fishing can be very productive.  Important fish habitat attributes include extensive beds of hardstem bulrush, yellow water lilies, and a diversity of submergent plants critical to sunfishes, largemouth bass, crappie, and northern pike.  Walleyes are stocked to sustain a modest fishery. <br> 
 <br> 
The recent fish community assessment occurred in mid-July 2013.  Northern pike proved to be very abundant.  Lengths of pike captured ranged from 14.5  33.9 inches.  Average size of the catch was 19.9 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Much of the catch was comprised of young fish, three to five-years-of-age fish.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest surplus of 17.0  21.0 inch fish.  <br> 
 <br> 
Lake Villard supports healthy bass and panfish populations.  Bluegill sunfish are moderately abundant.  Size at capture in trapnets ranged from 4.5  8.7 inches.  Average length of the catch was 6.5 inches.  Age distribution of the population sample extended to age 12.  Due to the longevity, 12% of the bluegills captured in 2013 exceeded 8.0 inches.  Pumpkinseed sunfish are also common.  Largemouth bass are less abundant, but the population supports good fishing.  While their numbers are not high, 56% of bass captures exceeded 15.0 inches.  Black crappie catches were limited, but low catches are not atypical during summer surveys when water temperatures are elevated.  Actual population density is uncertain, but the lake can give up some nice size fish.  The largest crappie caught measured 12.6 inches in length. <br> 
 <br> 
The walleye catch rate of 4.2 fish/gillnet was reasonably good in light of high mortality induced by an over-abundance of northern pike.  Length at capture ranged from 9.6 - 24.4 inches, which reflects presence of eight age groups in the population sample.  Average size of walleyes caught in gillnets was 16.5 inches which is a 1.8 pound fish. <br> 
 <br> 
Notes: <br> 
Rank growth of aquatic vegetation, that may include curly-leaf pondweed, can impair navigation and fishing in shallow bay areas. <br>

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/23/2007 Clarity: .9' 
 Narrative = '<p>Westport Lake is located one mile west of Westport.  It is a shallow, excessively fertile lake that frequently winterkills. Maximum depth of Westport is 12 feet. An access is located on the north side of the lake off a frontage road owned by Minnesota Department of Transportation. The ramp is unimproved. <br> 
 <br> 
Water quality is poor in Westport Lake. Transparency is less than a foot due to severe and frequent algae blooms and suspended sediment. Westport Lake was opened to unlimited fishing in February 2008, due to low oxygen. It was also opened to unlimited fishing in 2001. The frequent winterkills have and will likely continue to limit the fish community composition and fishing potential. <br> 
 <br> 
Westport Lake supports a quality northern pike fishery.  Pike are very abundant.  Average weight of captured fish was 3.6 pounds.  Large fish are not common. One fish exceeded 34 inches in length. <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie also proved to be abundant in 2007 in response to a strong recruitment of young crappie produced in 2005.  Two-year olds comprised 70% of the total catch of black crappie.  This year class should provide good fishing in 2009.  Crappie grow fast.  Older fish in the population sample exceeded 10.0 inches at age-4.  Those abundant two-year-olds averaged 8.0 to 9.5 inches at time of capture.  <br> 
 <br> 
Other gamefish observed included yellow perch and pumpkinseed sunfish.  No bluegill sunfish or largemouth bass were captured.  Habitat conditions are poor for sight-feeders, fishes dependent upon vegetation, and those intolerant of periods of low dissolved oxygen concentrations.  Tolerant species such as black bullheads, white sucker, and common carp made up an excessive proportion of the total poundage of fish captured during the 2007 survey.   <br> 
 <br> 
Management Update:  Westport Lake was opened to liberalized fishing opportunities in February 2008 in response to low dissolved oxygen concentrations and a high probability of winterkill.  Substantial mortality is projected due to the extended period of ice cover.  Fish community attributes described in the report are projected to be inaccurate.  The developing black crappie fishery has likely been lost.  Northern pike will quickly repopulate, but numbers and average size will have diminished.  <br>

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/01/2016 Clarity: 1.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Como Lake is a shallow, 70 acre lake located in a highly developed urban watershed in the City of Saint Paul. Como Lake receives direct runoff from 22 storm sewers and water quality is generally very poor. The entire lake is encompassed by Como Park, a regional park managed by Saint Paul Parks and Recreation. A fishing pier is located on the south shore of the lake along with a small parking lot. During summer this area of the lake can experience heavy submersed aquatic vegetation growth that may impede fishing from the pier with all but topwater baits. Chemical control of nuisance algae blooms and mechanical control of nuisance rooted aquatic plants have been conducted periodically. Several areas around the lake are conducive to shore fishing and much of the shoreline has been restored in recent years with native plantings. There is no official boat ramp on the lake but carry on watercraft and electric motors are allowed to be used, paddleboats are available to rent as well. <br> 
 <br> 
The primary management species on Como Lake are Bluegill Sunfish and Channel Catfish. Northern Pike, though not managed for, were abundant in the 2016 survey. The largest pike measured 33 inches, but most fish were in the 20" to 25" size range. Bluegill and Black Crappie were the most abundant species observed during this survey, though of small size, 5.5 inches and 6.7 inches respectively. Walleye were stocked most recently in 2011 (3,567 fingerlings-6 adults), 2013 (476 fingerlings), 2014 (71,000 fry and 4,108 yearlings), 2015 (2,840 yearlings) and 2016 (903 yearlings). Only two Walleye were sampled in trapnets during this survey, the fish measured between 7.5" and 18"long. Channel Catfish have been stocked into Como Lake during the periods of 2007-2011, 2014 and 2015. This survey sampled them in moderate abundance (3 total fish). These fish ranged in size from 17 to 22 inches long. These fish probably originated in the Sauk River near Cold Spring, Minnesota and have been netted and stocked into Como Lake since 2007. Black Bullhead were sampled in high abundance during this survey. Black Bullhead size and quality in Como Lake is above average when compared to most metro area lakes. The majority of the Black Bullheads ranged in size from 7.5 to 9.5 inches. Other species sampled in low abundance during this survey included Yellow Perch, Pumpkinseed and Hybrid sunfish and golden Shiners. <br>

 Narrative = '<p>Island Lake is a shallow (max depth 12') 60 acre eutrophic water body (Lake Class 42) located in the city of Shoreview in Ramsey County. It consists of two basins bisected by Interstate 694. Much of the north basin (20 acres) is developed with single family homes. Island Lake County Park owns most of the shoreline of the southern basin (40acres). The lake level in 2009 was 3 feet below the ordinary high water level. Island Lake has one small public boat launch located on the northwest corner of the south basin. Boat launching and parking can be a challenge at Island Lake as there are only 5 parking spaces available. A fishing pier was installed in 1990 and is located near the boat launch in the county park. Island Lake is prone to winter kill and a winter aeration system has been operated since in 1975. Eurasian Water-milfoil is present in the lake and it can be extremely abundant and dense during low water years which can effect boating and make shore angling difficult.  <br> 
Although Bluegills were the most abundant species in Island Lake, their numbers were below average for this type of lake. The average size found was only 5.0 inches with only a few sampled that were larger than 6 inches. Other sunfish species seen in the survey gear were Pumpkinseed and Hybrid Sunfish, both of which were not very abundant and were small in size. Black Crappies were found in moderate to low numbers and were generally small size also.  Averaging 24 inches Northern Pike were found in above average abundance. Sampled in lower abundance than in previous years, three Channel Catfish were examined and had an average size of almost 19 inches. Channel Catfish provide a fishing opportunity to catch a larger species for shore/pier based anglers.  Other fish sampled in low abundance were: Yellow Perch (N=9), Largemouth Bass (N=3), White Sucker (N=1) and Golden Shiner (N=1). <br>

The contributing watershed is characterized by residential, commercial, industrial and major roadways. Its lake class ID is 24 and is managed primarily for Walleyes and Tiger Muskellunge. Walleye fingerlings are stocked every other year at a rate of 2 pounds/littoral-acre and Tiger Muskellunge fingerlings are stocked every other year at a rate of 4.5 fish/littoral-acre (426 fish). Walleyes were captured at a rate of 2.50 fish/gill net. Walleyes captured during this assessment averaged 14.25 inches in total length and weighed an average of 1.16 pounds, 43% of Walleye captured during the survey were 15 inches or larger. A total of six Tiger Muskellunge were captured during this assessment. Tiger Muskellunge captured in gill nets averaged 26.02 inches in total length and 4.44 pounds. The one captured in a trap net was 43.31 inches. Northern Pike were captured at the second highest rate of abundance ever at 7.00 fish/gill net. Northern Pike sampled in the gill nets averaged 24.13 inches and 3.65 pounds, 56% of pike captured were 26 inches or larger. Although gill nets and trap nets are not the best way to assess Largemouth Bass, three were sampled in trap nets and seven were sampled in gill nets. Yellow Perch were sampled at about the same abundance as the previous survey. Average total length of perch in gill nets was 6.26 inches. Bluegills trap net abundance has decreased from 115.33 fish/trap net in 2008, to 27.22 fish/trap net during this assessment. Average total length of Bluegills in trap nets was 5.10 inches. Black Crappies abundance increased in gill nets and decreased in trap nets from the previous survey in 2008. Average total length of crappie in gill nets was 7.00 inches and in trap nets was 6.92 inches.

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/24/2006 Clarity: 8' 
 Narrative = '<p>Fox Lake is a small (311.7 acres), eutrophic lake in Rice County located near the Town of Millersburg.  A population assessment was conducted on Fox Lake in July of 2011 to assess the status of the fish community.  Residential development around the perimeter of Fox Lake is present primarily on the west/southwest shore.  The remainder of the shoreline is in good condition as approximately 1.5 miles of the shoreline is undeveloped and contains a thin riparian buffer zone separating the lake and adjacent agricultural fields.  A DNR owned ramp located on the south shore provides access for the public.  The sport fish community consists of bluegills, black crappies, northern pike, and walleyes.  The walleye and northern pike populations are maintained through stocking.  The current management plan calls for walleye fry stocking to occur in even years beginning in 2010, and for northern pike fry stocking to occur in 2 out of 3 years beginning in 2007.  <br> 
 <br> 
Past surveys have indicated low northern pike abundance in this system.  Gill net catch rates in 2011 were the highest recorded in the last two decades at 8.4/gill net, which is high for lakes similar to Fox Lake.  Although abundance was high, size of northern pike was small ranging from 13.8 to 27.2 inches in total length and averaging 19.2 inches.  Ninety-eight percent of northern pike sampled were less than 23.0 inches in length.  <br> 
 <br> 
Fox Lake supports a good population of walleyes when compared to other similar lakes.  Likely a result of fry stocking, walleyes were captured at a rate of 8.6/gill net in 2011, up from 3.6/gill net in 2006.  The size of the walleyes ranged from 8.1 to 19.1 inches in length and averaged 14.9 inches.  Sixty-seven percent of gill netted walleyes were between 15.0 and 19.0 inches in length. <br> 
 <br> 
Panfish abundance is relatively low when compared to similar lakes.  Bluegills were the most abundant panfish with a catch rate of 12.9/trap net, which is below average for similar lakes.  Black crappies were also present and had catch rates (2.1/trap net) that were below average for this lake class.  Size was small for bluegills and black crappies as 84% of bluegills were less than 6.0 inches in length and 82% of black crappies were less than 10.0 inches.  Consistent with past surveys, the 2011 survey indicated a low abundance, small panfish population. <br> 
 <br> 
Historically, yellow perch have been moderately abundant in Fox Lake with catch rates being above average compared to similar lakes in most years.  Catch rates in 2011 (7.2/gill net) were consistent with 2006 catch rates (6.6/gill net), but were below average when compared to similar lakes.  Yellow perch sampled in 2011 averaged 7.3 inches in length and did not exceed 8.5 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
Black bullhead populations have declined substantially since surveys done in the early 1990s.  Catch rates in 1991 were extremely high, as black bullheads were captured at a rate of 184.0/gill net and 305.5/trap net.  Catch rates have steadily declined in each subsequent survey and were captured at a rate of 0.8/gill net and 0.1/trap net in 2011.  <br> 
 <br> 
Bigmouth buffalo, bowfin, common carp, freshwater drum, golden shiner, largemouth bass, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and hybrid sunfish were observed but occurred in low numbers.  <br> 
 <br> 
Anglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Fox Lake and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> 
 <br> 
Shoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes.  Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes.  Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> 
 <br> 
Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br>

 Survey Date = '2016-04-19',  County Name = 'Rice', Lake Name = 'French' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/13/2007 Clarity: 1' 
 Narrative = '<p>French Lake is a hypereutrophic lake situated in an agricultural watershed with small woodlots northwest of the city of Faribault in Rice County. French Lake is classified as a class 24 lake with a Shoreline Development Index of 1.17. Lakeshore development is moderate to intense.  French Lake is the only Muskellunge managed water in the nine county Waterville Fisheries Management Area and has been stocked with Muskellunge fingerlings since 1974.  Historically, French Lake was stocked with approximately 600 Muskellunge fingerlings, of various strains, each fall.  Since 2014, French Lake has been stocked with approximately 400 Leech Lake strain Muskellunge fingerlings annually. A decreased stocking rate serves several purposes including: decrease the cost of Muskellunge stocking in French Lake, provide more Muskellunge to be stocked in other Muskellunge managed waters throughout the state, and decrease the potential for growth reductions due to high abundance.  The stocking rate of 1.0 Muskellunge per littoral acre annually will be maintained at least until a more in-depth population assessment can be completed.   <br> 
 <br> 
The first phase of a two-year population assessment was conducted in April, 2016.  Large-frame trap nets were used to sample adult Muskellunge beginning on April 19, 2016 and ending on April 29, 2016.  A total of 76 adult Muskellunge was sampled in 67 nets.  Catch-per-unit-effort was 1.1 adult Muskellunge per net lift which was similar to recent surveys, but below the 18 year average.  The average length was 40.7 inches and ranged from 33.9 inches to 51.6 inches.  Fifty-one percent of Muskellunge sampled were male, 28% were female, and 21% were of unknown gender.  The average length of female Muskellunge was 43.2 inches and the average length of male muskellunge was 38.7 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Trends in French Lake Muskellunge size structure are difficult to discern due to changing sampling methods.  However, large frame trap nets have been used since 1998 allowing comparisons among surveys conducted since 1998.  The average length of Muskellunge appears to have peaked since 2002 and has hovered around 40 inches in each survey since 2002.  Maximum length appears to have reached its full potential in 2004 and has been near 53 inches in since.  The proportions of fish greater than 38 inches and 42 inches have also remained relatively constant since 2002.  Muskellunge over 50 inches have always been rare in French Lake and only one fish longer than 50 inches was sampled in 2016.   <br> 
 <br> 
Population estimates on French Lake have also varied due to inconsistent collection methods.  Population estimates were conducted in 2002, 2004, 2007, 2010, and 2013.  Population estimates peaked in 2004 (731 adult Muskellunge) and were lowest in 2013 (296 adult Muskellunge).  It is important to standardize methods to determine if this decline is due to gear bias or if the population is truly decreasing. <br> 
 <br> 
Methods used to conduct Muskellunge population estimates were altered in 2016 in an attempt to standardize methods and avoid ineffective electrofishing.  Future population estimates will be calculated based on surveys conducted in consecutive springs using only large frame trap nets as sampling gear.  The one year time-frame between sampling periods will eliminate net avoidance.  However, conducting the recapture portion of a population estimate one year removed from the mark portion requires a reliable, long-term marking solution.  Therefore, all Muskellunge collected in 2016 were implanted with a tag containing a unique numeric code.  Recapture of marked fish will take place in spring of 2017.  Population estimates calculated in 2017 will reflect the population of adult Muskellunge (greater than 30 in) in French Lake in 2016.  Also, beginning in fall 2016, all fingerling Muskellunge will be implanted with tags prior to stocking.  Unique markings on fish will aid in population estimates as well as provide information on recruitment, growth, and mortality. <br> 
 <br> 
French Lake's novelty as the only Muskellunge lake in the Waterville area would suggest it receives a relatively high amount of muskellunge-targeted fishing pressure; however, no angler survey data is available to substantiate this assumption. <br> 
 <br> 
Anglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> 
 <br> 
Shoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population.  Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion.  By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br>

 Narrative = '<p>Phelps Lake is a 299 acre lake located in Rice County east of the city of Montgomery. A public access is located on the north side of the lake, across the road from the Cody Lake public access. Phelps Lake is connected to Cody Lake by a channel going under the road that separates the two water bodies. Phelps Lake is a shallow lake with a maximum depth of only 8.0 feet. Based on lake characteristics, Phelps Lake is placed in Lake Class 43. Similar area lakes with this classification include Loon Lake (Blue Earth County), Rice Lake (Rice County), and Scotch Lake (Le Sueur County). Phelps Lake is managed for Bluegill, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike, all of which are stocked as adults as needed either directly or indirectly (stocked into connected Cody Lake). Phelps Lake and Cody Lake experienced winterkills in the winter of 2013-14, after which Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, and Bluegill were immediately stocked to rebuild the population. Phelps Lake was surveyed the week of August 17, 2015 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying four gill nets and nine trap nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill <br> 
With a catch rate of 282.5 fish/trap net, Bluegill dominated the catch throughout the 2015 Phelps Lake survey. This was easily the highest Bluegill catch rate on record for Phelps Lake, as the second highest catch rate was 16.5 fish/trap net (2000). The 2015 catch rate was above the long-term average for Phelps Lake (45.6 fish/trap net). Despite the high catch rate, the Bluegill population was composed primarily of young, small individuals. About 85% of the aged Bluegills were either age-1 or age-2 and the average length of all Bluegills in both net types was only 4.4 inches. However, some large individuals were present, as the largest fish measured 9.2 inches. Adult pre-spawn Bluegill were stocked in Phelps Lake in 2014 to jump start the population after the winterkill during the winter of 2013-14. The large individuals observed in the 2015 survey were likely some of the adults that were stocked in 2014. The high catch of age-1 fish suggested that natural reproduction was successful. Bluegills will continue to be managed in Phelps Lake and stocked following winterkills to serve as a recreational fishery. Additionally, Bluegills are adept at predating on Common Carp eggs, so they will also aid in keeping Common Carp abundance at bay.  <br> 
 <br> 
? <br> 
Yellow Perch <br> 
Yellow Perch were sampled at a rate of 13.7 fish/gill net, which exceeded the long-term average for Phelps Lake (7.4 fish/gill net). The length of Yellow Perch sampled in gill nets ranged from 4.7 to 11.7 inches and averaged 8.3 inches, which indicated that the Yellow Perch population was primarily composed of quality-length individuals. Pre-spawn Yellow Perch adults were stocked in 2014 to help rebuild the population after the winterkill of 2013-14. The presence of age-1 individuals suggested that the stocked population successfully reproduced. Typical of a post-winterkill situation, the Yellow Perch population had fast growth rates. The mean length was 4.6 inches at age-1, 8.6 inches at age-2, and 10.6 inches at age-3. In the event of a winterkill, Yellow Perch will be immediately stocked to rebuild the population.  <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike <br> 
The 2015 Northern Pike catch rate was 0.5 fish/gill net, which was less than the long-term average for Phelps Lake (4.1 fish/gill net). The average length of Northern Pike from both gear types was 21.0 inches, indicating a small size structure.  Northern Pike were aged with scales and all fish from this survey were age-2. These fish likely resulted from the stocking event in connected Cody Lake in 2014, when Northern Pike fry were stocked in the spring and adults were stocked in the winter. Northern Pike fry are stocked in Cody Lake two of every three years, which also supplies Phelps Lake since fish can easily move from one lake to another through the channel near the public access. Northern Pike will also be stocked immediately following a winterkill. <br> 
 <br> 
Black Bullhead <br> 
Black Bullheads were sampled in gill nets at a rate of 132.0 fish/net, which was the second highest gill net catch rate on record for Phelps Lake. This catch rate xceeded the long-term average for Phelps Lake (108.1 fish/gill net). These Black Bullheads ranged in length from 4.1 to 12.5 inches and averaged 7.8 inches, indicating a small size structure. Black Bullheads seldom completely succumb to winterkill, making it difficult to manage density levels. After the severe winterkill of 2013-14, Black Bullhead was likely the only fish species that remained in Phelps and Cody Lakes. <br> 
 <br> 
Other Species <br> 
Only one Common Carp was sampled in this survey, which suggested that Common Carp succumbed to winterkill in 2013-14. Common Carp have the ability to decrease aquatic vegetation density, decrease water clarity, and increase occurrence of blue-green algae blooms, so efforts to reduce abundance in Phelps Lake will continue. Other fish species sampled in the 2015 survey in low abundance included green sunfish (N = 7), Black Crappie (N = 1), Yellow Bullhead (N = 1), and hybrid sunfish (N = 3). <br> 
 <br> 
Angling Summary <br> 
At the time of this survey, the Yellow Perch population was worth the trip to Phelps Lake to catch the abundant, quality-sized fish. Also, keep in mind the extremely abundant, but young population of Bluegill that will be quickly growing into harvestable size. Shoreline angling opportunities exist on the north side of Phelps Lake along the road. Also, a fishing pier is available for use on the south side of Cody Lake, which is connected to and only separated from Phelps Lake by a road.  <br> 
 <br> 
Anglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural reproduction. This practice helps maintain balance in the fish populations and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br> 
 <br> 
Shoreline property owners also play an important role in the overall health of an aquatic ecosystem, including the fish population. Natural shorelines, including vegetation, woody debris, and bottom substrates, provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife, help maintain water quality, and reduce bank erosion. Cattails and bulrushes are particularly beneficial for fish spawning, rearing, and feeding. By leaving natural shorelines unaltered or restoring them to natural conditions, shoreline property owners are doing their part to maintain or improve a healthy ecosystem in the lake and protect the resource for future generations. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2014-08-18',  County Name = 'Rice', Lake Name = 'Wells' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/22/2014 Clarity: 1.1' 
 Narrative = '<p>Introduction <br> 
 <br> 
Wells Lake is a 634 acre lake located in Rice County west of the city of Faribault. The lake is accessible by boat from Cannon Lake. Wells Lake is a very shallow, eutrophic lake with a maximum depth of 4 feet. Based on limnological variables and lake characteristics, Wells Lake is placed in Lake Class 43. Other area lakes with this classification include Cody Lake (Rice County), Ida Lake (Blue Earth County), and Loon Lake (Waseca County). Wells Lake is managed primarily for walleye. Although no stocking takes place, walleye and other game fish regularly migrate into Wells Lake from Cannon Lake and other lakes within the Cannon River chain. Wells Lake was surveyed the week of August 10, 2014 as part of a regular monitoring program conducted by Minnesota DNR. This survey was intended to assess the fish community by deploying gill nets and trap nets, as well as recording water quality parameters. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye <br> 
Walleye abundance in Wells Lake increased from 2.1 fish/net in 2004 and 0.3 fish/net in 2009 to a record high 23.8 fish/net in 2014. The next highest catch rate of walleye in Wells Lake was in 1989 when 12.6 fish/net were sampled. This was the highest walleye catch observed among all area surveys conducted in 2014. Walleye lengths ranged from 8.3 to 26.1 inches and averaged 11.6 inches, indicating a very small size structure. Walleye otoliths were removed and aged. Ninety-nine percent of all walleye sampled were age-1, indicating a very strong year class from 2013. These young walleye most likely migrated into Wells Lake from Cannon Lake, which was stocked with over two million walleye fry in 2013. Wells and Cannon Lakes are directly connected by water under a bridge, so the likelihood of fish migration is high. The warm, shallow, productive waters of Wells Lake may serve as a nursery habitat for walleye and other young game fish to grow in early life stages before migrating throughout the Cannon River chain of lakes.  <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch <br> 
Yellow perch catch rates in Wells Lake have varied greatly throughout the survey history, as abundance is dependent on spawning success from year to year. The yellow perch catch rate in Wells Lake increased from zero fish in the 2009 survey to 29.8 fish/net in 2014. This catch rate was above the long-term average for Wells Lake (21.8 fish/net). Yellow perch lengths ranged from 5.5 to 10.8 inches and averaged 6.9 inches, indicating a small size structure of yellow perch. Yellow perch populations throughout the Cannon River chain of lakes tend to be comprised of small sizes, however some yellow perch angling takes place. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike <br> 
Northern pike abundance in Wells Lake has been relatively low throughout the survey history. The 2014 catch rate was the highest among recent years with 2.3 fish/net, which is above the long-term average for Wells Lake (1.2 fish/net). Lengths of northern pike ranged from 16.2 to 24.4 inches and averaged 21.2 inches, indicating a small size structure. All northern pike collected in this survey were age-1 (2013 year class). This further suggests that Wells Lake serves as a nursery habitat for young fish. No northern pike stocking takes place in Wells Lake, so the population exists from either natural reproduction or migration from other lakes within the Cannon River chain. <br> 
 <br> 
Black Crappie <br> 
The black crappie population in Wells Lake remains in moderately low abundance with a 2014 trap net catch rate of 3.1 fish/net. This is an increase from the 2009 survey when the catch rate was 1.3 fish/trap net and compares to the long-term average for Wells Lake of 4.0 fish/net. Black crappie were also collected in gill nets in 2014 at a rate of 2.4 fish/net. Lengths of all black crappie collected in this survey ranged from 3.1 to 11.5 inches, with 39% of the catch measuring 10.0 inches or larger, indicating a quality size structure.  <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill <br> 
Bluegill abundance remains low in Wells Lake. The 2014 catch rate was 1.4 fish/net, which is below the long-term average of 2.0 fish/net. Bluegill lengths ranged from 4.3 to 9.1 inches, with 77% measuring less than 6.0 inches, indicating a small size structure. Bluegill populations tend to struggle in lakes with minimal macrophyte abundance, such as Wells Lake.   <br> 
 <br> 
White Bass <br> 
White bass abundance in Wells Lake has fluctuated in recent history, with catch rates ranging from 57.8 fish/net in 1999 to 4.8 fish/net in 2009. The 2014 catch rate of white bass was 13.0 fish/net, which is high relative to other similar lakes. Not only was the catch rate relatively high in 2014, the size of white bass was also impressive. Lengths ranged from 4.6 to 17.4 inches, with 41% of the catch measuring over 10.0 inches. The Cannon River chain of lakes, including Wells Lake, have quality white bass populations and offer a valuable angling opportunity, especially with population demographics like that of Wells Lake. White bass can be caught throughout the year, including through the ice, and are considered great table fare.  <br> 
 <br> 
Black Bullhead <br> 
Black bullhead typically thrive in shallow, eutrophic lakes similar to Wells Lake. However, the abundance in Wells Lake has remained low for years. The 2014 catch rate in gill nets was 3.0 fish/net, which is very low for Lake Class 43. The population consisted of mostly large individuals, with lengths ranging from 6.3 to 13.4 inches. Eighty-one percent of the catch measured 10.0 inches or larger. Predators, such as walleye and northern pike, will feed on young black bullhead. While many factors may influence the low abundance of black bullhead in Wells Lake, predation may play a role in keeping the numbers at bay. <br> 
 <br> 
Other Species <br> 
Common carp were collected in high abundance in 2014, with a total of 190 fish sampled from gill and trap nets. While common carp catch rates have varied in Wells Lake, abundance has always been relatively high. Common carp thrive in shallow, eutrophic lakes like Wells Lake. Freshwater drum and white sucker were also abundant (N = 84 and N = 25, respectively). Other fish species collected in low abundance included bigmouth buffalo (N = 5), bowfin (N = 14), channel catfish (N = 5), largemouth bass (N = 1), yellow bullhead (N = 13), and golden shiner (N = 1). <br>

Anglers can play an important role in maintaining or improving a fish population by practicing selective harvest.  Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for consumption, while encouraging the release of medium to large fish that may contribute to natural recruitment.  This practice helps maintain balance in the fish community and provides anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  Additionally, smaller fish often taste better and have fewer contaminants than larger, older fish from the same water body. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '1999-08-16',  County Name = 'Rock', Lake Name = 'South Mound Springs' 
 Lake Clarity = '' 
 Narrative = '<p>Blue Mound is primarily managed for black and white crappie.  The surrounding watershed land use tends to make this reservoir highly fertile and turbid.  Like most small reservoirs in Minnesota, Blue Mound has a problem with siltation which causes spawning habitat destruction.  The turbid water hinders aquatic vegetation from becoming established which is considered spawning habitat for adult fish and nursery habitat for younger fish.  Additionally, Blue Mound was suspect for a "winterkill" in the winter of 1991-92.  Despite the conflicts and challenges facing fish, the black crappie population has survived but in low numbers.  The black crappie average catch rate was 4.17 fish per net.  Total lengths of black crappie sampled ranged between 7.7 and 13.8 inches, with an average of 9.5.  A mode was observed in the range of 8.0 to 8.5 inches which could provide good table fare.  Interestingly, white crappies were sampled in the 1991 survey but were not in the 1995 or 1999 survey.  The black bullheads sampled in Blue Mound were small in size but numerous.  The average black bullhead trap net catch rate was 34.33 fish/net set which was down from 1991 survey (48.5 fish/net set).  Total lengths of black bullhead ranged between 5.1 and 11.4 inches, with an average of 7.8.  This population provides an excellent opportunity for kids to learn how to fish because the high population density likely translates to fast angling action.Other species which inhabit Blue Mound include orangespotted and green sunfish, channel catfish, largemouth bass, yellow perch, pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, and fathead minnows.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Blue Mound Reservoir through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.</p>'

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2013-05-20',  County Name = 'Scott', Lake Name = 'O'Dowd' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/29/2013 Clarity: 4' 
 Narrative = '<p>O'Dowd is a highly productive Class 42 lake located just south of Shakopee.  It is 300 acres, with a maximum depth of 22 feet.  The lake's shoreline is complex, with numerous islands scattered throughout the lake, and bottom substrates varying between muck and large rocks.  A good portion of the lake shore is developed with single-family homes and there is an 18-hole golf course on the north shore. Because of a combination of a fertile watershed, shallow depth, and development, Lake O'Dowd is a very nutrient-rich lake; a winter aeration system has been operated since the mid-1980s to help sustain fish populations.  (In winter 2010-11, a partial winterkill was noted in spite of an operating aerator.) <br> 
 <br> 
Despite issues associated with a shallow, eutrophic lake, O'Dowd remains an important fishery and recreational resource in the local area.  It is primarily managed for Walleye and Northern Pike and secondarily for Largemouth Bass and Bluegill.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked annually.  In 2013, a population assessment was conducted, consisting of spring trap netting and night-time electrofishing, followed by summer gill netting.   <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye are abundant in Lake O'Dowd, and of quality size.  The catch rate in 2013, 8.2 fish per gill net, was slightly higher than the previous survey (2007; catch of 7.8 fish per gill net). Prior to 2007, catch rates of walleye had been noticeably lower, ranging from 1.3 fish per net in 1996, to 4.3 fish per net in 1991. The average size of Walleye in 2013 was 16.8 inches and 2 pounds.  Thirty-six percent of fish were longer than 16 inches, and 28% were longer than 20 inches.  Ages two through nine were represented in the sample, with the majority of fish age 2. Walleye growth appears fast in O'Dowd, relative to statewide average.  Fish reach 16 inches by age 3.   <br> 
 <br> 
While Northern Pike are only moderately abundant, they are of good size.  The catch rate in 2013, 3.5 fish per gill net was lower than the previous survey value (5/3 fish per gill net in 2007).  Historically, Northern Pike abundance has been high, but has been gradually decreasing since it peaked at 8.8 fish per net in 1996. Average size of Northern Pike has increased since the previous survey, from 3.0 pounds in 2007 to 3.6 pounds in 2013. Average length of Northern Pike in 2013 was 24.6 inches, with fish as large as 37 inches sampled.  Ninety percent of the sampled fish were longer than 21 inches, and 24% of the sample was longer than 28 inches. Ages two through six appeared consistently in the sample, with one age eight. Northern Pike growth appears fast relative to statewide averages of length at age.  Fish reach 24 inches by age 4.   <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth Bass were abundant in the night-time electrofishing sample (102.3 per hour on-time), relative to other lakes in the West Metro area; however, few large fish were sampled. Thirty-two percent of the sample was longer than 12 inches, and 5% were longer than 16 inches. The largest Bass sampled was 19.9 inches.  The average weight of Largemouth Bass was 0.8 pounds.  Fish ages 2 through 10 were present in the sample.  The fish reached 12 inches by age 4, and 20 inches by age 10.   <br> 
 <br> 
Although only moderately abundant, Black Crappie sampled in the spring trap nets were of quality size.  The catch rate of 4.1 per trap net falls below the median for this type of lake, and the fish average 8.7 inches and 0.4 pounds.  Forty-seven percent of the fish caught were longer than 8 inches, and 39% were longer than 10 inches.  The largest Black Crappie measured 12.0 inches.  Ages two through seven were represented in the trap net sample.  Black Crappie grow fast in Lake O'Dowd, reaching 10 inches by age four.   <br> 
 <br> 
Lake O'Dowd has historically had a highly abundant population of small-sized Bluegill.  While this continues to be the case from this survey's results, abundance-average size balance appears to be more favorable.  Trap net catch rates have decreased from 85 fish per trap net in 2007 to 35 fish per trap net in 2013 (still high for this type of lake).  Size has also improved, from an average length of 5.1 inches in 2007 to an average length of 6.1 inches in 2013.  Sixty-six percent of the Bluegill sampled in 2013 were larger than 6 inches, and only two percent were larger than 8 inches.  Not surprisingly, these fish are slower growing relative to statewide averages of length at age.  Lake O'Dowd Bluegill attain a length of 6 inches by age 5.   <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2009-06-29',  County Name = 'Sherburne', Lake Name = 'Camp' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/29/2009 Clarity: 10' 
 Narrative = '<p>Camp Lake is a small (79 acres), but relatively deep (34 feet maximum), natural environment lake. The lake has a history of winterkills, the most recent reported in the winters of 1979, 1985 and 1986.  Sporadic oxygen testing has occurred over the past 20 years revealing that oxygen was present in sufficient levels during the winters of 1988, 1992, 1993 and 2001.  No other reports of winterkills have been reported since 1986.  Prior to 2009 the lake had low priority for management because of its small size, lack of a developed access, and history of winter kill.  An initial survey was done in 1958 with a resurvey in 1980.   <br> 
In between those years a feedlot located on the north end of Camp Lake contributed greatly to its demise.  The bass-panfish fishery present in 1958 was gone.  Winterkill had eliminated all but black bullheads and fathead minnows.  Water clarity was poor, algal blooms occurred and black bullheads were abundant.  Since the feedlot was remediated (circa 1996) Camp Lake has seen improvement in water quality and fisheries.  This was the first full lake survey since 1980.  <br> 
Fish catches were generally low except for bluegill, largemouth bass and black bullhead. <br> 
 <br> 
The origin of fish in Camp Lake is not known.  The only stocking which has occurred since 1985 was 1,060 walleye fingerlings, by the lake association in 2006.  Four small walleyes between 11-14 inches were taken with gill nets (1.0/lift).  Yellow perch were not captured.  <br> 
 <br> 
Only one northern pike was captured, 27.5 inches and 8.0 pounds.  Since Camp Lake is isolated and spawning habitat seems poor, northern pike will likely remain at a low level. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill were abundant although the catch was within the range of expected values for similar lakes.  The average length of bluegill was 6.6 inches.  Bluegill grew at a rate similar to statewide averages.  A four year old bluegill was 6.5 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth bass were captured at a rate which was twice that of Sherburne County lakes.  However, bass were small, less than 12 inches.  Growth of largemouth was below the statewide average.  Largemouth did not reach 12 inches in length until age seven. <br> 
 <br> 
Black bullheads were also abundant, three times the average for similar lakes.  Most bullheads were nine inches long. <br> 
 <br> 
Other species captured were black crappie (one in a gill net), pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish. <br> 
 <br> 
The aquatic plant community of Camp Lake was diverse and vegetation grew to a depth of 15 feet.  Eight species of submerged aquatic plants were observed.  Coontail, northern milfoil, and sago pondweed were common; but all other aquatic plant species were rare.  The following species were widespread throughout the lake: Naiad, Fries pondweed, narrowleaf, flatstem, and Illinois pondweed.  Curly leaf pondweed was not abundant when surveyed on June 4th, 2009 and was limited to one small area in the northeast corner of the south basin.</p>'

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2007-06-11',  County Name = 'Sherburne', Lake Name = 'East Hunter' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/11/2007 Clarity: 5.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>East and West Hunter Lakes are small, shallow, connected lakes located four miles west of Zimmerman in eastern Sherburne County.  In 1986 Livonia Township secured title to a parcel on the northwest shore of West Hunter Lake and made arrangements with DNR for a cooperative access.  The Hunter Lakes have a history of oxygen depletion and winterkill of fish has been observed every 5-6 years.  Management has been limited to oxygen testing and re-stocking of bluegill and black crappie after winterkill.  The most recent stocking was in 2001.  This is the first survey since the initial survey in 1987. <br> 
 <br> 
Water quality has been an ongoing problem in the lakes with algal blooms common.  Curled pondweed was found to grow at or near the surface on 2.8% of the surface area on West Hunter Lake and 92% of the surface area on East Hunter Lake.  Twenty-seven species of aquatic plants were noted with coontail and northern water milfoil the most abundant.  <br> 
 <br> 
Two notable changes from the 1987 survey were catches of northern pike and black bullhead. Northern pike were not taken in the 1987 survey although no gill nets were used.  Catch rates are at or above the normal range when compared to similar lakes.  Anglers have a good opportunity to catch a three pound northern pike.  The golden shiner population appears high and provides forage for northern pike.  Black bullheads were still abundant but at much lower levels than in 1987.  <br> 
 <br> 
A primary management species for the Hunter Lakes is largemouth bass.  The Hunter Lakes have an excellent bass population with a wide range of sizes available to anglers including fish up to 18 inches.  Little is known about the former condition of the largemouth population as 2007 was the first opportunity to sample with day-time electrofishing. <br> 
 <br> 
The Hunter Lakes have abundant populations of bluegills but not black crappies.  Few quality size bluegills can be found in the Hunter Lakes and only one black crappie larger than seven inches was captured in the trap nets.  The average size of the bluegills was about five inches and the average size of black crappie was six inches.  Bluegills in the Hunter Lakes grow slowly.  A seven inch bluegill is seven years old. <br> 
 <br> 
Other species in the fish community include:  hybrid and pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker. <br> 
 <br> 
Improving the water quality in the Hunter Lakes should be a high priority of the county and landowners around the lake.  Some effort may be needed to identify any sources of excess phosphorus and plans developed to reduce these sources.  Buffer strips along inlets and lakeshore property are encouraged to reduce nutrients entering the lake. Maintaining adequate septic systems and keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out the lake will help reduce the amount of nutrients entering the lake, thus slowing algal and vegetation growth.  <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2009-06-22',  County Name = 'Sherburne', Lake Name = 'Elk' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/22/2009 Clarity: 2.7' 
 Narrative = '<p>Big Elk Lake (360 acres) is a general development lake located in western Sherburne County.  The lake is shallow (nine feet maximum) and greatly influenced by the Elk River which flows through it.  For instance, studies have shown that the largest phosphorous inputs to Big Elk Lake are from the Elk River (77% of total phosphorous).  Riverine fish species were common: silver and shorthead redhorse, and white sucker.  Beneficially, walleye reproduce and provide a fishery that doesnt need stocking.   In spite of the (eutrophic) riverine influence the fish populations have been stable, for the most part, since 1980.  Walleye exist at moderate levels and populations of most sport species were at low levels. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye have not been stocked in Big Elk Lake since 1980 although the Briggs Chain Association was granted a permit to stock in 2009.  In 2009 the catch was 3.7 walleye/gill net.   This compares to previous surveys (in 1986, 1993, and 1999) when the catch rate was about the same.  Average weight and length were 20 inches and three pounds.  Growth of female walleye was fast, reaching nearly 18 inches by age three; and males grew to 16 inches by age three.  Anglers report good fishing for walleye especially in the spring at the mouth of the Elk River where it enters Elk Lake.   <br> 
 <br> 
The catch rate of northern pike (10.8/gill net) increased significantly over 1999 (5.0/net) and was above the expected range for the lake class.   Average length and weight were still good, 22 inches and three pounds, respectively.   Northern pike ranged in length from 12 to 36 inches.  Thirty-two percent of northern pike were greater than 24 inches.  Growth of northern pike was faster than statewide averages.  Both male and female northern pike reached 24 inches in four years.  Anglers can expect above average success for northern pike. <br> 
 <br> 
As in 1999 no largemouth bass were taken during spring electrofishing or with gill and trap nets.  One smallmouth bass was captured.   Lack of vegetation in Big Elk Lake may limit the panfish populations.  Turbid conditions (caused by the flow of the Elk River), feeding activity of carp, and the sand and gravel substrate inhibit plant survival in Big Elk Lake. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill populations were low as they were in the last survey in 1999.   The bluegill catch has been below the range of normal in all of the surveys since 1980.     <br> 
 <br> 
The black crappie catch also was below the expected range for lake class 43.   <br> 
Catch rates for white sucker (32/gill net) have been high in each of the past five surveys (average 24.5/gill net).  Black bullhead numbers (1.3/trap) have declined from 1986 (11.2/trap.     <br> 
 <br> 
Catch rates of common carp (0.11/trap) were below the normal range for the lake class, although the trap nets probably understate the true abundance which is thought to be higher. <br>

 Narrative = '<p>East and West Hunter Lakes are small, shallow, connected lakes located four miles west of Zimmerman in eastern Sherburne County.  In 1986 Livonia Township secured title to a parcel on the northwest shore of West Hunter Lake and made arrangements with DNR for a cooperative access.  The Hunter Lakes have a history of oxygen depletion and winterkill of fish has been observed every 5-6 years.  Management has been limited to oxygen testing and re-stocking of bluegill and black crappie after winterkill.  The most recent stocking was in 2001.  This is the first survey since the initial survey in 1987. <br> 
 <br> 
Water quality has been an ongoing problem in the lakes with algal blooms common.  Curled pondweed was found to grow at or near the surface on 2.8% of the surface area on West Hunter Lake and 92% of the surface area on East Hunter Lake.  Twenty-seven species of aquatic plants were noted with coontail and northern water milfoil the most abundant.  <br> 
 <br> 
Two notable changes from the 1987 survey were catches of northern pike and black bullhead. Northern pike were not taken in the 1987 survey although no gill nets were used.  Catch rates are at or above the normal range when compared to similar lakes.  Anglers have a good opportunity to catch a three pound northern pike.  The golden shiner population appears high and provides forage for northern pike.  Black bullheads were still abundant but at much lower levels than in 1987.  <br> 
 <br> 
A primary management species for the Hunter Lakes is largemouth bass.  The Hunter Lakes have an excellent bass population with a wide range of sizes available to anglers including fish up to 18 inches.  Little is known about the former condition of the largemouth population as 2007 was the first opportunity to sample with day-time electrofishing. <br> 
 <br> 
The Hunter Lakes have abundant populations of bluegills but not black crappies.  Few quality size bluegills can be found in the Hunter Lakes and only one black crappie larger than seven inches was captured in the trap nets.  The average size of the bluegills was about five inches and the average size of black crappie was six inches.  Bluegills in the Hunter Lakes grow slowly.  A seven inch bluegill is seven years old. <br> 
 <br> 
Other species in the fish community include:  hybrid and pumpkinseed sunfish,  white sucker. <br> 
 <br> 
Improving the water quality in the Hunter Lakes should be a high priority of the county and landowners around the lake.  Some effort may be needed to identify any sources of excess phosphorus and plans developed to reduce these sources.  Buffer strips along inlets and lakeshore property are encouraged to reduce nutrients entering the lake. Maintaining adequate septic systems and keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out the lake will help reduce the amount of nutrients entering the lake, thus slowing algal and vegetation growth.  <br>

 Narrative = '<p>The Sauk River Chain of Lakes is located in south central Minnesota, near the city of Richmond.  A dam on the Sauk River at Cold Spring allows users to access over 3,200 acres by water.  The Sauk River drains a large portion of central Minnesota before flowing through the chain of lakes.  Combined with drainage from the Long Lake sub-watershed to the south, the total watershed of the chain is nearly 600,000 acres.  Although non-point source pollution (agricultural run-off) continues to be a concern, some major contributors of nutrient loading (such as municipal wastewater discharge) were greatly reduced in the 1980's and 1990's.  Efforts continue to be made to address existing nonpoint pollution sources, but most of the lakes in the chain remain classified as hypereutrophic (nutrient-rich). <br> 
 <br> 
Most of the Sauk River Chain was re-surveyed in 2013, with the exception of Horseshoe and Cedar Island which were surveyed prior to the introduction of Muskellunge in 2011.  Netting results from the river portion of the chain (lakes downstream of Cedar Island Lake - Zumwalde, Great Northern, Krays, Knaus, Schneider, and Bolfing) were similar and were combined for this summary.  <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth Bass were assessed in the spring by day-time electrofishing.  Portions of Zumwalde, Great Northern, Krays, Knaus, Schneider, and Bolfing were sampled.  Catch rates were down from previous surveys and were less than half the rate typically observed in other lakes in the Montrose management area.  Cooler than average spring water temperatures likely affected seasonal patterns as most bass sampled came from deeper water making it much harder to effectively sample bass with traditional electrofishing gear.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 6.1 to 19.5 inches with a mean length of 13.3 inches.  Of the catchable size Largemouth Bass, 83% were greater than 12 inches and 49% were greater than 15 inches. Smallmouth Bass also comprised 13% of the bass sampled by electrofishing. <br> 
 <br> 
The catch rate of Northern Pike in 2013 was within the range of expected values for lakes similar to the Sauk River Chain, and similar to the 2003 survey.  Since 1980, catch rates of Northern Pike in these lakes have been relatively stable.   Northern Pike ranged in length from 17.8 to 35.6 inches with an average length and weight of 23.1 inches and 2.2 pounds. <br> 
 <br> 
From 2000 to 2007, the Walleye population was supported through fry stocking by the Sauk River Chain of Lake's Association.  Nearby Cedar Island and Horseshoe Lakes are also biennially stocked with fry by the DNR, and migration among the lakes was verified by fall electrofishing in 2011 when fingerings were sampled throughout the eastern portion of the chain where none were stocked.  Fry stocking in 2009 on Horseshoe and Cedar Island Lakes was very successful and the catch throughout the Sauk River Chain was dominated by this year class.  The Walleye catch rate in 2013 was within the range expected for the Sauk River Chain, and similar to the 2003 survey.  Walleye ranged in length from 13.1 to 25.6 inches and averaged 17.6 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Walleye growth was average when compared to statewide data and grew to a length of 16.3 inches by age 4. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch catch rates increased slightly from 2003 to 2013 survey but remained below the expected range for similar lakes.  Yellow Perch ranged in length from 5.4 to 9.3 inches and averaged 6.8 inches and 0.16 pounds.  Prior to the 2003 survey, catch rates of Yellow Perch were significantly higher on these lakes. <br> 
 <br> 
Channel Catfish were introduced into the chain in 1976 and have become well established.  In the 1985 and 1990 surveys, Channel Catfish were sampled at relatively low rates in the river portion of the chain, but the population appeared to expand in the early 1990s.  Schneider Lake has been an exception to this trend, as the catch rate has remained low.  Schneider Lake has clearer water, more submerged vegetation, is less river-like, and is probably less favorable for Channel Catfish.  Channel Catfish ranged in length from 10.9 to 25.8 inches with a mean length and weight of 17.6 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Growth rates of Channel Catfish were relatively slow as fish grew to an average length of 17.7 inches in eight years. <br> 
 <br> 
The Black Crappie catch was unchanged from 2003 in the eastern portion of the chain of lakes and generally exceeded the expected range for these types of lakes.  Black Crappie ranged in length from 2.3 to 13.0 inches with an average length and weight of 8.4 inches and 0.36 pounds.   <br> 
 <br> 
The Bluegill catch in 2013 was very similar to 2003, and remained at the low end of the range of expected values for similar lakes.  Bluegill ranged in length from 2.8 to 9.4 inches with an average length and weight of 5.6 inches and 0.24 pounds. <br> 
 <br> 
One Muskellunge, a two year old 24.6 inch female, was sampled in Knaus Lake during the 2013 survey.  This fish was stocked in the fall of 2011 as a fingerling and was likely between 11 and 13 inches at the time of stocking.  This suggests that Muskellunge have the potential for excellent growth in the Horseshoe Chain of Lakes.  All muskie fingerlings stocked in the Horseshoe Chain in the fall of 2013 were implanted with an electronic tag under the dorsal fin which will allow the DNR to track the individual growth of fish in the future and is part of a research project to assess the success of the muskie introduction to the Horseshoe Chain of Lakes. <br> 
 <br> 
Other species sampled during the 2013 survey included: hybrid and Pumpkinseed sunfish, Bigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin, Yellow, Brown, and Black bullhead, Golden, Greater, Shorthead, and Silver redhorse, White Sucker, and Common Carp.</p>'

 Lake Clarity = '' 
 Narrative = '<p>Maria Lake is located in northwestern Stearns County, near the town of New Munich.  The lake is 100 acres in size, with a maximum depth of 45 feet.  A local conservation club maintains a public access at the south end of the lake.  The lake is eutrophic, and partial winterkills sometimes occur in years with heavy snow and ice cover.  In 2001, a fisheries survey was conducted that included electrofishing, gillnetting, trapnetting, shoreline seining, and a plant survey.The lake is managed primarily for northern pike and largemouth bass.  In 2001, the northern pike population appeared to be relatively large for a lake like Maria, although the catch rate was lower than the previous survey (1990).  Pike had an average length of 20 inches, and an average weight of 1.8 pounds.  The largest individual sampled was 26 inches.  Twenty-nine largemouth bass were sampled in the spring by electrofishing (26 fish/hr).  The catch rate was lower than average for the Montrose management area (55/hr).  However, several bass were larger than 17 inches, with the largest nearly 20 inches.Black crappie were relatively abundant, and numbers appeared to be up from 1990.   Most of the crappie sampled in 2001 were from the 1997 and 1998 year classes, and these fish were in the range of 7-8.5 inches.  Bluegill numbers remained at a level typical for a lake like Maria, and most were between 5 and 7 inches.  Growth rates for all of the game species appeared to be similar to statewide averages.  Small black bullheads were abundant, and lower numbers of brown and yellow bullheads were also present.  White sucker, common carp, bowfin (dogfish) were also sampled in numbers typical for this type of lake.</p>'

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/04/2012 Clarity: 3' 
 Narrative = '<p>Sand Lake is located in north central Stearns County, three miles southwest of Albany.  It has a surface area of 202 acres and a maximum depth of about 15 feet.  A public access is located along the west shore.  Due to the shallowness of the lake and poor water quality, the lake periodically experiences partial winterkill.  This occurred most recently during 2011.  A population assessment was conducted in 2012 to assess fish populations, and included spring electrofishing and summer trap netting.  Catch rates were compared to lakes with similar characteristics as a way to evaluate the fish populations. <br> 
  <br> 
Sand Lake is managed for walleye and crappie, and these species can grow quickly following winterkill events.  Walleye were stocked as fry in 2005, and survival was moderate (21.5 fingerlings/hour), based on night electrofishing in the fall of 2005.  Gillnets, which sample walleye most effectively, were not used in the 2012 survey and only one 20 inch walleye was sampled by trap nets.  Anglers have reported some success for walleyes in Sand Lake, but a more thorough assessment that includes gillnets would be necessary to accurately measure walleye abundance.  The population of black crappie appeared to be very good both in terms of numbers and average size.  Black crappies were sampled at a rate of 318/trap net, which is over 15 times greater than the range typically found in lakes similar to Sand.  Most of the crappies were about 7.5 inches in length, but 13 percent of the crappies sampled were greater than nine inches.  Without additional winterkill, these crappie should provide a good fishery for the next few years. <br> 
  <br> 
Only three largemouth bass were captured in a half hour of electrofishing.  The water clarity was very poor at the time of sampling and likely affected the catch.  The bass ranged in size between 15 and 17 inches in length.  Smallmouth bass have also been sampled in previous surveys. <br> 
 <br> 
The catch rate of bluegill was within the range of expected values for similar lakes.  Most bluegill were between 5-7 inches in length. <br> 
 <br> 
Only one northern pike (25 inches) and one yellow perch (8.5 inches) were sampled in trap nets.  <br> 
 <br> 
Other species sampled during the survey included bigmouth buffalo, black bullhead, common carp, hybrid sunfish, and golden shiner. Large numbers of common carp were observed during the spring electrofishing and most were between 14 and 16 inches in length. <br> 
 <br> 
Despite the fact that the watershed of Sand Lake is quite small, water quality is poor.  Nutrients entering the lake from run-off, as well as those re-suspended from the lake bottom, create nuisance algal blooms.  The reduced water clarity also limits growth of submersed aquatic plants, which provide important fish habitat.  Much of the shore is lined with cattails and bulrush, which offers habitat for fish and wildlife, and also provides protection from shoreline erosion. <br>

Yellow Perch ranged in length from 5.4 to 9.3 inches and averaged 6.8 inches and 0.16 pounds.  Prior to the 2003 survey, catch rates of Yellow Perch were significantly higher on these lakes. <br> 
 <br> 
Channel Catfish were introduced into the chain in 1976 and have become well established.  In the 1985 and 1990 surveys, Channel Catfish were sampled at relatively low rates in the river portion of the chain, but the population appeared to expand in the early 1990s.  Schneider Lake has been an exception to this trend, as the catch rate has remained low.  Schneider Lake has clearer water, more submerged vegetation, is less river-like, and is probably less favorable for Channel Catfish.  Channel Catfish ranged in length from 10.9 to 25.8 inches with a mean length and weight of 17.6 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Growth rates of Channel Catfish were relatively slow as fish grew to an average length of 17.7 inches in eight years. <br> 
 <br> 
The Black Crappie catch was unchanged from 2003 in the eastern portion of the chain of lakes and generally exceeded the expected range for these types of lakes.  Black Crappie ranged in length from 2.3 to 13.0 inches with an average length and weight of 8.4 inches and 0.36 pounds.   <br> 
 <br> 
The Bluegill catch in 2013 was very similar to 2003, and remained at the low end of the range of expected values for similar lakes.  Bluegill ranged in length from 2.8 to 9.4 inches with an average length and weight of 5.6 inches and 0.24 pounds. <br> 
 <br> 
One Muskellunge, a two year old 24.6 inch female, was sampled in Knaus Lake during the 2013 survey.  This fish was stocked in the fall of 2011 as a fingerling and was likely between 11 and 13 inches at the time of stocking.  This suggests that Muskellunge have the potential for excellent growth in the Horseshoe Chain of Lakes.  All muskie fingerlings stocked in the Horseshoe Chain in the fall of 2013 were implanted with an electronic tag under the dorsal fin which will allow the DNR to track the individual growth of fish in the future and is part of a research project to assess the success of the muskie introduction to the Horseshoe Chain of Lakes. <br> 
 <br> 
Other species sampled during the 2013 survey included: hybrid and Pumpkinseed sunfish, Bigmouth Buffalo, Bowfin, Yellow, Brown, and Black bullhead, Golden, Greater, Shorthead, and Silver redhorse, White Sucker, and Common Carp.</p>'

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/29/2013 Clarity: 2.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>The Sauk River Chain of Lakes is located in south central Minnesota, near the city of Richmond.  A dam on the Sauk River at Cold Spring allows users to access over 3,200 acres by water.  The Sauk River drains a large portion of central Minnesota before flowing through the chain of lakes.  Combined with drainage from the Long Lake sub-watershed to the south, the total watershed of the chain is nearly 600,000 acres.  Although non-point source pollution (agricultural run-off) continues to be a concern, some major contributors of nutrient loading (such as municipal wastewater discharge) were greatly reduced in the 1980's and 1990's.  Efforts continue to be made to address existing nonpoint pollution sources, but most of the lakes in the chain remain classified as hypereutrophic (nutrient-rich). <br> 
 <br> 
Most of the Sauk River Chain was re-surveyed in 2013, with the exception of Horseshoe and Cedar Island which were surveyed prior to the introduction of Muskellunge in 2011.  Netting results from the river portion of the chain (lakes downstream of Cedar Island Lake - Zumwalde, Great Northern, Krays, Knaus, Schneider, and Bolfing) were similar and were combined for this summary.  <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth Bass were assessed in the spring by day-time electrofishing.  Portions of Zumwalde, Great Northern, Krays, Knaus, Schneider, and Bolfing were sampled.  Catch rates were down from previous surveys and were less than half the rate typically observed in other lakes in the Montrose management area.  Cooler than average spring water temperatures likely affected seasonal patterns as most bass sampled came from deeper water making it much harder to effectively sample bass with traditional electrofishing gear.  Largemouth Bass ranged in length from 6.1 to 19.5 inches with a mean length of 13.3 inches.  Of the catchable size Largemouth Bass, 83% were greater than 12 inches and 49% were greater than 15 inches. Smallmouth Bass also comprised 13% of the bass sampled by electrofishing. <br> 
 <br> 
The catch rate of Northern Pike in 2013 was within the range of expected values for lakes similar to the Sauk River Chain, and similar to the 2003 survey.  Since 1980, catch rates of Northern Pike in these lakes have been relatively stable.   Northern Pike ranged in length from 17.8 to 35.6 inches with an average length and weight of 23.1 inches and 2.2 pounds. <br> 
 <br> 
From 2000 to 2007, the Walleye population was supported through fry stocking by the Sauk River Chain of Lake's Association.  Nearby Cedar Island and Horseshoe Lakes are also biennially stocked with fry by the DNR, and migration among the lakes was verified by fall electrofishing in 2011 when fingerings were sampled throughout the eastern portion of the chain where none were stocked.  Fry stocking in 2009 on Horseshoe and Cedar Island Lakes was very successful and the catch throughout the Sauk River Chain was dominated by this year class.  The Walleye catch rate in 2013 was within the range expected for the Sauk River Chain, and similar to the 2003 survey.  Walleye ranged in length from 13.1 to 25.6 inches and averaged 17.6 inches and 2.0 pounds.  Walleye growth was average when compared to statewide data and grew to a length of 16.3 inches by age 4. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch catch rates increased slightly from 2003 to 2013 survey but remained below the expected range for similar lakes.  Yellow Perch ranged in length from 5.4 to 9.3 inches and averaged 6.8 inches and 0.16 pounds.  Prior to the 2003 survey, catch rates of Yellow Perch were significantly higher on these lakes. <br> 
 <br> 
Channel Catfish were introduced into the chain in 1976 and have become well established.  In the 1985 and 1990 surveys, Channel Catfish were sampled at relatively low rates in the river portion of the chain, but the population appeared to expand in the early 1990s.  Schneider Lake has been an exception to this trend, as the catch rate has remained low.  Schneider Lake has clearer water, more submerged vegetation, is less river-like, and is probably less favorable for Channel Catfish.  Channel Catfish ranged in length from 10.9 to 25.8 inches with a mean length and weight of 17.6 inches and 1.7 pounds.  Growth rates of Channel Catfish were relatively slow as fish grew to an average length of 17.7 inches in eight years. <br> 
 <br> 
The Black Crappie catch was unchanged from 2003 in the eastern portion of the chain of lakes and generally exceeded the expected range for these types of lakes.  Black Crappie ranged in length from 2.3 to 13.0 inches with an average length and weight of 8.4 inches and 0.36 pounds.   <br> 
 <br> 
The Bluegill catch in 2013 was very similar to 2003, and remained at the low end of the range of expected values for similar lakes.  Bluegill ranged in length from 2.8 to 9.4 inches with an average length and weight of 5.6 inches and 0.24 pounds. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2016-06-13',  County Name = 'Stevens', Lake Name = 'Charlotte' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/13/2016 Clarity: 1.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Lake Charlotte is a 468-acre, shallow lake located one mile west of Cyrus in Stevens County.  The basin has a mean depth of 13.3 feet and maximum depth of approximately 20.0 feet.  During periods of elevated water levels, the lake is connected to Moore Lake by a small channel on the north shoreline.
  
Water clarity and quality are poor due to nutrient enrichment.  Algal blooms are common and can be severe during summer months.  Due to limited water transparency and sunlight penetration to the lake bottom, aquatic vegetation is sparse.  Periodic winterkill events have been documented.  Lake Charlotte was well known for its Yellow Perch fishery and ability to produce "jumbo" perch in the late-1980s and early-1990s.  This fishery was eventually depleted or lost to winterkill.
  
Fish management programming was limited to occasional fish community assessments prior to acquisition and development of a public access in 2008.  Reports from surveys completed in 1990 and 2007 detailed a fish community dominated by roughfishes, namely Black Bullhead, Bigmouth Buffalo, Common Carp, and White Sucker.  Low-density populations of Walleye, Black Crappie, and Northern Pike offered only fair fishing opportunities.  Walleye fry stockings were initiated in 2008 with public access development and have been sustained in even-numbered years to increase population abundance and enhance fishing potential.  Yellow Perch adults were also stocked in 2014 to re-establish that population and expand fish community diversity.

A standard MN DNR lake survey was completed in June 2016 to re-assess fish community composition and determine successes of Walleye stockings initiated in 2008.  Survey results described substantial changes to fish community structure.  Bigmouth Buffalo and Common Carp remained very abundant.  Black Bullhead and White Sucker catch rates were greatly reduced.  Gamefish angling opportunities have improved.  Walleyes are now much more abundant, largely due to contributions of the 2014 fry stocking.  Two-year-old Walleyes made up much of gill net catches.  Mean size of Walleye captures was 12.9 inches and 0.9 pounds.  The largest Walleye captured measured 25.4 inches in length.  Black Crappie abundance increased greatly.  Trap net catches averaged 45.8 crappies/net.  Ages of captures extended from age 1 through age 6.  Reproductive success was particularly good in 2011, 2012, and 2014.  Crappies captured in trap nets averaged 8.7 inches.  An estimated 17% of Crappie captures exceeded 10.0 inches in length.
 
Habitat conditions remain harsh and limiting for sight-feeding and vegetation-dependent gamefishes such as Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass, and Bluegill.  A low-density Northern Pike population continued to persist in the lake.  Ten were captured in gill nets.  These captures averaged 24.8 inches.  The largest pike captured measured 32.8 inches in length.   No Largemouth Bass or Bluegills were captured during the 2016 survey.  Only 15 Yellow Perch were captured.  These fish were too small to add to the fishery.  The largest perch measured was just 7.2 inches in length.

Other species that have been sampled in Lake Charlotte include Orangespotted Sunfish and Yellow Bullhead.  The next standard survey is tentatively scheduled for 2026.

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2011-06-13',  County Name = 'Stevens', Lake Name = 'Hattie' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/19/2006 Clarity: 3' 
 Narrative = '<p>Lake Hattie is a shallow, hyper-eutrophic basin located in Stevens County, three miles south of Alberta.  An improved DNR public access is located on the northwest shoreline.  Maximum depth is approximately 9.0 feet.  Low water can restrict navigation in some areas.   Large rocks on the lake bed can cause watercraft damage. <br> 
  <br> 
Dense algal blooms and suspended sediment limit water clarity during much of the summer.  Secchi disk measurements have rarely exceeded 3.0 feet.  Rooted aquatic plants are scarce due to poor water clarity.  In absence of vegetation and in response to poor water clarity, sunfishes and densities of sight-feeding predators such as northern pike and largemouth bass are usually low.   Lake Hattie's fish community has been chronically threatened by potential of winterkill.  An aeration system is operated by a sportsmen's group (Save-A-Lake Association) to prevent winterkill. <br> 
   <br> 
An unusual and severe openwater fish kill occurred in October 2009.  It appeared that walleye were most impacted, but other fishes such as common carp and black bullheads were observed.  Fish community attributes described from the 2011 survey reflect this fish kill and other anomalies that would typically result from increased water clarity and improved habitat conditions.  Based on past survey documentation, such changes are likely to be temporary or short-lived. <br> 
  <br> 
Because of limiting habitat conditions for sight-feeding predators, vegetation-dependent species such as bluegill, and fishes vulnerable to low dissolved concentrations during ice cover, management emphasis has been directed at walleye.  Walleye fry have been stocked annually from 2005 through 2011. Contributions of fry stocking to population abundance have been unpredictable and inconsistent, but generally successful.  An atypically low catch rate of only 1.3 walleye/gillnet during the 2011 survey reflected losses to the October 2009 fish kill.  Average weight of walleyes captured was 3.2 pounds.  Fortunately, walleye grow fast in Lake Hattie and approach 15.0-inches in 3 years.  It is anticipated that the walleye fishery will rebound quickly. <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie were rare or absent in Lake Hattie prior to 2001.  Adult crappie were stocked in late spring of 2002 to establish a population.   It has taken time, but a reproducing population has developed.   Survival and recruitment of young crappie to the population may have been enhanced but less predation from and competition with walleye.  Trapnet catches during the 2011 survey were dominated by one-year -old crappies averaging 4.5 inches in length.  In absence of future fish kill events, these crappies will grow to 10.0 inches in length by the 2013 fishing opener.  The largest crappie caught during the survey measured 13.8 inches.  <br> 
  <br> 
Northern pike experienced very good spawning success in 2008.  Young pike showed up in gillnets this past year as three-year-olds averaging about 18-inches in length.  A promising yellow perch fishery was lost to the fish kill.  Most of the many 6.0 to 10.0 inch perch observed during the 2006 survey were absent from the 2011 survey.  No bluegill or largemouth bass were captured. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2011-08-15',  County Name = 'Stevens', Lake Name = 'Long' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/18/2011 Clarity: 2.9' 
 Narrative = '<p>Long Lake is a shallow, 579-acre prairie lake located approximately two miles southwest of Cyrus in west-central Minnesota.  Maximum depth is 12.0 feet.  Wind-driven suspension of sediments and subsequent algal blooms can significantly reduce water clarity through summer months.  In response to seasonally poor water quality, diversity and density of submerged plants is limited.  Sight- feeding predators such as northern pike and largemouth bass struggle to maintain a population.  Numbers of bass and northern pike are very low.  Open water species such as walleye and black crappie are better able to tolerate turbid water and very limited vegetated habitat.  Even these valued gamefishes are subject to catastrophic losses from occasional summer and winterkill events.  Partial winterkills were documented in 2001 and 2004.  <br> 
  <br> 
Walleye fry are stocked at an alternate year frequency. Survey statistics describe a quality walleye fishery.  Gillnet catches during the 2011 survey were lower than 2006 catches, but still within the range of expected catch rates for similar lakes.  Age distribution of 2011 captures correlated well with stocking chronology.  Growth of young fish is excellent.  Age-2 walleye averaged 17.0 inches in length at the time of the August survey.  Mean size was 18.9 inches and 2.4 pounds.  Twenty-two percent of walleye captured during the 2011 survey exceeded 20.0 inches in length. <br> 
 <br> 
Stocking of adult black crappie in 2002 was successful in establishing a self-sustaining fishery.  Black crappie catches during the 2011 survey exceeded expected catch rates for similar lakes. Most captures were young fish.  Average length of crappie captured was 8.0 inches.  Crappie grow quickly and the many three-year-old crappie in the population should exceed 10.0 inches in length in 2012.  The largest black crappie measured 13.2 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch have prospered in response to lower walleye densities and absence of severe winterkill events since 2004.   Long Lake is one of few lakes in the Glenwood Management Area that have perch large enough to stimulate angler interest and harvest.  Signs of harvest may have been evident in the length distribution of the 2011 population sample.  Twenty percent of yellow perch captured during the 2006 survey exceeded 12.0 inches in length.  No 12.0-inch or larger yellow perch were measured in 2011.  Only a few exceeded 10.0 inches, but there were many perch approaching 10.0 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegills depend on aquatic vegetation for feeding and escape cover.  There are also not very tolerant of low dissolved oxygen concentrations, thus few if any were captured in early surveys.  In probable response to improved habitat conditions a modest population expansion was documented during the 2011 survey.  Four age groups were represented in the population sample.  Due to fast growth, approximately 14% of captures exceeded 10.0 inches in length.  The largest fish measured 11.4 inches.  In absence of significant environmental disturbances such as loss of water clarity or winterkill events, this population may finally be able to support quality fishing opportunities if harvest is not excessive. <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
Fishery Update........................... <br> 
 <br> 
A black crappie die-off was documented on August 29, 2011.  Approximately 1,000 dead crappie were observed.  These fish ranged from 5.0 to 11.0 inches in length.   An ice-out population assessment will be completed in 2012 to determine severity of the summerkill event. <br>

 Survey Date = '2011-08-29',  County Name = 'Stevens', Lake Name = 'Page' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/16/2011 Clarity: .5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Page Lake is a shallow, very fertile lake located immediatley north of Hancock in southeast Stevens County.  Maximum depth is approximately 17.0 ft. The lake receives extensive nutrient loading from its agricultural watershed via County Ditch 6A.  These added nutrients often result in dense algal blooms during summer months.  In absence of a severe bloom, water clarity averages approximately 5.0 ft.  Seasonally poor water clarity and subsequent lack of submerged vegetation constitute a poor environment for cover-dependent and ambush feeding predators such as bluegill, northern pike and largemouth bass.   Those gamefishes reasonably tolerant of existing habitat conditions include walleye, yellow perch, and black crappie.  Even these gamefishes have been subject to infrequent winterkill events. <br> 
   <br> 
Page Lake is stocked with walleye fry on an alternate year schedule.  Contributions of stocking have been inconsistent.  Survey catches in 2011 documented that the 2008 stocking was very successful.  Walleye catches averaged 20.0 fish/gillnet.   All captures were age-3.   Average length of fish captured during the August survey was 16.0 inches.  Mean weight of walleye captured was 1.4 pounds. <br> 
   <br> 
A quality perch fishery currently exists in Page Lake.  Twenty-one percent of survey captures exceeded 10.0 inches in length.  Six percent of perch captures exceeded 12.0 inches.  Growth is exceptional.  Yellow perch in Page Lake approached 10.0 inches after three years.  Average length of sampled perch was 8.8 inches.  Mean weight was 0.36 pounds.  <br> 
  <br> 
A severe winterkill in 1989 claimed the black crappie population.  No crappie were captured during 1991, 1995, and 2001 surveys.   Adult black crappie were stocked in spring of 2002 in an effort to restore the population and enhance fishing potential.  Restorative stocking was successful in achieving those objectives.  Trapnet catches greatly exceeded expected catches for similar lakes.   Ninety-four percent of captures were age-1 fish.  Growth to age-3 was exceptional.  Average length of these young fish was 9.6 inches.  In absence of winterkill, these fish will provide an exceptional fishery beginning as early as 2012. <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth bass, northern pike, and bluegill are present, but population densities are low due to limiting habitat conditions.  Young bluegill are observed, but due to lack of escape cover, few survive to catchable size.   With little competition, survivors grow fast.  Age-4 bluegill averaged 8.5 inches in total length.  The largest bluegill captured during the 2011 survey was 9.5 inches. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2012-06-11',  County Name = 'Stevens', Lake Name = 'Perkins' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/11/2012 Clarity: 3' 
 Narrative = '<p>Perkins Lake is a shallow, turbid lake located on the Pomme de Terre River in Stevens County. Poor water quality, lack of submerged aquatic vegetation, and degraded aquatic habitat has been described in lake survey reports since the initial survey in 1947.  The river transports excessive amounts of nutrients and sediments through the lake from a very expansive and predominately cultivated watershed area.  High total phosphorous and total suspended solid concentrations have been documented in annual water quality monitoring conducted by the Perkins Lake Association.  Water transparency during the 2012 assessment was 3.0 feet.  Blue-green algae blooms are common in July and August due to elevated nitrogen concentrations.  <br> 
 <br> 
Preceding fish population assessments were conducted in August.  The 2012 fish population assessment was rescheduled to occur in June in order to complete surveys on non infested basins before surveys are conducted in AIS infested waters.   Scheduling changes can result in substantial increases or decreases in catch rates and size distribution of gamefish in response to seasonal habitat changes such as water temperature differences, aquatic plant coverage and diversity, or thermal stratification of the water column.  Projected impacts of changing the survey date from August to mid-June included a lower walleye catch rate,  but greater catches of northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegills, black and white crappies;and yellow perch.  Anticipated changes in catch rates were realilzed for some gamefishes.  Threre proved to be sufficient changes in capture rates of walleye and northern pike by survey timing to preclude utilization of 2012 catch statistics in trend analyses. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegills are not abundant in Perkins Lake due to limiting habitat conditions, thus the survey timing change had little impact of catch rates.  Though not abundant, bluegills grow fast.  Most bluegill captures exceeded 8.0 inches in length. <br> 
 <br> 
Sight-feeding, ambush predators such as largemouth bass and northern pike face difficult feeding condition and other harsh habitat conditons that limit abundance.  Only seven largemmouth bass were captured during the spring electrofishing survey.  All were young fish.  As projected, the greatest gillnet catch rate of 3.0-pike/net occurred during the June 2012 survey.  Pike captures averaged 19.4 inches.  The largest caught measured 29.8 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Perkins Lake in the Pomme de Terre River supports a naturally recruiting walleye population.  Supplemental fry stockings are programmed in odd-numbered years to sustain greater walleye abundance and a more consistent fishery.   Walleye catch rates among surveys completed in August average an exceptional 14.0 walleyes/gillnet.  Gillnet catches during thte June 2012 survey averaged only 2.8 fish/net.  The population sample was comprised of relatively young walleyes.  Captures averaged 15.7 inches in length and 1.5 pounds.  No 20.0-inch and larger walleyes common in preceding surveys were recorded in the total walleye catch.  It can be assumed that walleye are more abundant than characterized by 2012 survey findings. <br> 
 <br> 
Both black and white crappies exist in Perkins Lake.   White crappie captures outnumber black crappies.  Catch rates of both species exceeded average catches for lakes similar to Perkins Lake.  White crappie catches were elevated in response to establishment of a strong year class in 2006.  This population offers good fishing, since cohorts of the 2006 year class are 10.0 inches and larger.  The largest white crappie captured measured 13.9 inches in length.  Black crappie abundance is bouyed by a strong year class established in 2010.  Cohorts of this age class should grow to exceed 10.0 inches in length in 2013. <br> 
 <br> 
Contrary to expectations, fewer yellow perch were captured during the 2012 survey than the seven preceding surveys.  Gillnet catches averaged 6.3 perch/net.  Lower catches is concerning since yellow perch grow large enough to add to the fishery.  Eighteen percent of perch captured during the 2012 survey exceeded 10.0 inches in length.   <br> 
 <br> 
Due to limiting habitat conditions for various gamefishes, underutilized or roughfish species constitute much of the lake's carrying capacity.  Black bullhead and white sucker comprised over 65% of the poundage of all fish caught in gillnets.  Opportunities exist to catch fishes more common to river systems.  Survey catches included bigmouth buffalo, river redhorse, shorthead redhorse, and freshwater drum. <br>

 Survey Date = '2007-06-04',  County Name = 'St. Louis', Lake Name = 'Blueberry' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/04/2007 Clarity: 3' 
 Narrative = '<p>Blueberry Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 17,which consists of 99 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, shallow, and have turbid and soft (unmineralized) water.  Blueberry Lake ranks as eutrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index. <br> 
 <br> 
Blueberry Lake was not thermally stratified on 06/04/2007, with a temperature of 65 F throughout the water column.  Oxygen levels were at saturation to the bottom.  Blueberry Lake has been known to winterkill on occasion.  Blueberry Lake has three inlets, two of which drain local swamps and one that originates in Canary Lake (22 acres, 4 ft deep) 1/3 mile to the west.  Beaver dams in the inlets limit fish movement.  The outlet, which has no barriers to fish movement, is to the Bear Island River. <br> 
 <br> 
Most of the land surrounding Blueberry Lake is in State or Federal ownership.  A small parcel on the northern tip of the lake, west of the outlet, is privately owned and has a house on it.  The public access is a gravel boat ramp on the east side of the outlet adjacent to the CSAH 120 bridge. <br> 
 <br> 
Fish sampling in the 2007 fisheries lake survey was done with two gillnets, nine standard trapnets, and three small mesh (1/4" bar) trapnets used to sample small fish.  Three previous fisheries investigations, dating back to 1965, used 2-3 gillnets and 6-7 standard trapnets.  Shoreline seines were used in the 1965 investigation to sample small fish. <br> 
 <br> 
Fish populations in 2007 were dominated by northern pike, white sucker, yellow perch, and bluegill sunfish. Black bullhead were captured in the small mesh trapnets in 2007, the first observation of this species in this lake and in this watershed.  They are probably survivors of a "bait-bucket" introduction by anglers, and will likely spread to other lakes over time with potentially negative consequences. Largemouth bass have never been captured in DNR investigations on Blueberry Lake, but were reported to be present by a local angler in 2007.   <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike numbers in 2007 (10.5/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 6.8/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2007 averaged 21.4" (2.0 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class.  The largest pike was 27.0".  Most of the pike captured in 2007 were ages 3-6.  Pike growth was somewhat slower than normal (in the second quartile) by area standards. <br> 
 <br> 
Perch numbers in 2007 (9.5/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 11.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Perch sizes in 2007 averaged 8.9" (0.35 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class.  The largest perch was 11.8".  Most of the perch captured in 2007 were age 4.  Perch growth was faster than normal (in the fourth quartile) by area standards.  <br>

Bluegill numbers in 2007 (7.6/trapnet) were higher than in previous investigations on this lake (range: 0.2-1.4/trapnet), perhaps due to the earlier date of trapnetting in 2007.  Bluegill sizes in 2007 averaged 7.9" (0.51 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class.  The largest bluegill was 11.1" (1.4 lb).  Most of the bluegill captured in 2007 were age five.  Bluegill growth was faster than normal (in the fourth quartile) by area standards. <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie numbers in 2007 (1.2/trapnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 1.4/trapnet in all investigations on this lake.  Crappie sizes in 2007 averaged 7.6" (0.31 lb), which was in the second quartile for this lake class.  The largest crappie was 11.8".  Crappie growth was faster than normal (in the fourth quartile) by area standards. <br> 
 <br> 
Several large walleye (range: 19.5"-22.3") were captured in 2007.  Similar numbers and sizes of walleye were captured in previous investigations on this lake.  They were probably migrants from One Pine Lake, as spawning conditions for walleye in Blueberry Lake are very poor. <br> 
 <br> 
A few of the game fish examined in 2007 were infected with neascus.  One perch was infected with yellow grub. Neascus (black spot) and yellow grub are common parasites that are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting fish, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>'

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2008-07-07',  County Name = 'St. Louis', Lake Name = 'Coe' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/07/2008 Clarity: 5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Coe Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 13, which consists of 84 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, shallow, and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Coe Lake has water that is softer and darker (more bog-stained, due to tannic and humic acids) than most of the lakes in this lake class.   Coe Lake ranks as mesotrophic-to-eutrophic on Carlson's Trophic State Index, but the very low total alkalinity (3 ppm) indicates limited chemical and biological productivity. <br> 
 <br> 
Coe Lake has no inlets or outlets.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 8 ft, and about 15% of the lake is covered by floating-leaf or emergent plants; bladderwort, water shield, stonewort, and burreeds are the most common plants.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly muck, followed by sand and gravel. <br> 
   <br> 
Coe Lake was thermally stratified on 07/07/2008 with a surface temperature of 74 F and a bottom temperature of 55 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 9 ft, where the temperature was 68 F.  Winter dissolved oxygen testing on 04/04/2008 indicated 2 ppm oxygen was retained to a depth of 6 ft and oxygen dropped below 1 ppm at 8 ft. <br> 
   <br> 
Coe Lake is surrounded on the east by State School Section land and on the west by County Tax-Forfeit land.  Ten state leased cabin sites on the southeast bay were sold to the owners of the cabins some time ago.  Two access sites on this portion of the lake were retained, including a gravel boat ramp and a picnic area with a carry-down boat access. <br> 
 <br> 
Fish populations in 2008 were sampled with two gillnets, nine standard trapnets, and four small mesh trapnets for catching small fish.  Six previous fisheries investigations, dating back to 1961, used 2-4 gillnets and 3-17 standard trapnets.  Small fish were sampled with shoreline seines in 1961, and small mesh trapnets in 1982 and 1986. <br> 
 <br> 
Fish populations in 2008, as in other recent investigations on this lake, were dominated by bluegill sunfish, northern pike, and yellow perch.  Largemouth bass numbers were higher in 2008 than in previous investigations, although bass are "net shy" and difficult to accurately assess with standard sampling nets. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill sunfish were absent in the initial fisheries investigation in 1961 and low numbers of sunfish were stocked in 1963 (144 adults) and 1964 (150 yearlings).  These introductions were successful, as high numbers of bluegill were captured in all subsequent investigations.  Also captured in subsequent investigations were pumpkinseed sunfish, making it likely they were mixed in with the stocked bluegill.  Bluegill numbers in 2008 (90.9/trapnet) were very high.  Unlike some previous investigations where bluegill sizes were small, bluegill captured in 2008 were nice-sized and 24% were 8" or larger.  Growth of bluegill captured in 2008 was somewhat faster than normal (in the third quartile) by area standards.  Good bluegill reproduction occurs in most years in this lake.  <br> 
 <br> 
No northern pike were captured in the gillnets in 2008, down from the median pike catch of 2.7/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Only one pike was caught in the trapnets.  We have no explanation for the apparent decline of the pike population in 2008, as pike are easily caught in gillnets when they are present. <br> 
 <br> 
Perhaps due to the decline in pike numbers, perch numbers in 2008 (13.0/gillnet) were higher than the median perch catch of 3.0/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Perch are a primary prey for northern pike.  Perch sizes in 2008 averaged 7.4" (0.17 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class.  The largest perch was 9.1".  Perch growth was slower than normal by area standards. <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth bass numbers in 2008 (1.5/gillnet, 1.4/trapnet) were higher than normal for this lake class and were higher than in previous investigations on this lake.  Bass from many year-classes were present, and bass growth was somewhat faster than normal by area standards. <br> 
 <br> 
Many of the game fish examined in 2008 were infected with neascus (black spot), and many of the perch were also infected with yellow grub.  Neascus and yellow grub are common parasites that are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting fish, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish. <br> 
 <br> 
In summary, Coe Lake has developed into a classic bass-panfish lake with quality-sized fish of each species present.  The relative absence of northern pike and the higher perch population may help maintain the quality of the bluegill population by perch foraging on small bluegill.  <br>

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/03/2009 Clarity: 8' 
 Narrative = '<p>Cooks is a 99-acre lake with 90 acres (91%) of littoral area and a maximum depth of 19 feet.  Cooks Lake is located 4 miles northeast of Taft, Minnesota off Highway #48.  Cooks Lake, which has no public access, is just upstream of Island Reservoir on an unnamed tributary to the Cloquet River.  Cooks Lake was surveyed during the summer of 2009 as part of an effort to evaluate the impacts of the aquatic macrophyte wateshield on local lakes and to update information on fish populations. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye abundance of 1.0 per gillnet lift had increased since 1991 (0.2) but was still considered below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 22.6 inches was large and growth was fast.  Five year-classes were represented from 1998 through 2004 and no walleye were younger than age-5. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike abundance of 4.8 per gillnet lift had decreased since 1991 (7.8) but was still considered typical compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 27.2 inches was considered very large and growth was typical.  Age analysis revealed consistent recruitment with all year-classes represented from 1999 through 2007. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch abundance of 8.0 per gillnet lift had decreased since 1991 (15.2) but was still considered typical compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 6.6 inches was considered small and growth was typical.  Age analysis revealed only the 2003 and 2004 year-classes represented with 2004 being strong. <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie abundance of 1.9 per trapnet lift had decreased since 1991 (8.0) but was still considered typical compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 7.3 inches was considered small and growth was slow.  Age analysis revealed consistent recruitment with all year-classes represented from 2003 through 2007 and a strong 2006 year-class. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill abundance of 17.3 per trapnet lift was slightly greater than 1991 (16.8) but still considered above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average size of 4.6 inches was small and growth was slow.  Age analysis revealed consistent recruitment with all year-classes represented from 2000 through 2007 and a very strong 2005 year-class. <br> 
 <br> 
Other fish species sampled include largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish and smallmouth bass. <br> 
 <br> 
Information was collected on aquatic vegetation, substrate and water quality.  Diversity of aquatic plants was low with 24 species or species groups identified along 10 transects.  Muskgrass was the most frequently identified plant (100% of transects) followed by large-leaf pondweed and watershield (90% of transects).  Only two other species or species groups had a frequency of occurrence greater than 50%.  Lakeshore residents around Cooks Lake have reported a dramatic increase in the distribution and density of watershield in recent years.  In response, a special assessment of watershield was completed in conjunction with the 2009 survey.  An aerial photography analysis revealed that in 2003, 14.1 acres of Cooks Lake was covered with watershield.  In 2009, 14.7 acres were covered with watershield, a 3.4% increase from 2003.  It is suspected that low alkalinity as well as longer, warmer growing seasons are contributing factors to the increase in watershield abundance.  Other lakes in the Duluth Area (Sand and Cross in Carlton County) with similar water chemistry are experiencing increases in the abundance of watershield.  The most common substrate type was sand, which was identified at 100% of the transects.  All other substrate types identified had frequencies of occurrence less than 50%. Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Cooks is a slightly alkaline (pH 7.6), soft water lake (alkalinity 10 ppm) with low fertility (total phosphorus 0.018). <br>

 Narrative = '<p>Dark Lake is a 232-acre lake located 9 miles north of Buhl, MN.  The lake has a maximum depth of 31 ft and a littoral area of 138 acres.  Dark Lake is in lake class 11 and has a public access on the west shore of the north basin.  Water chemistry analysis indicated hard water with an alkalinity of 199 ppm, and low fertility with a total phosphorous of 0.02 ppm.    <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye gill-net catch was 1.0/net and was similar to the lower end of the expected range.  Gill net catch rates have historically been low and varied from 0 to 2.7/net.  Sample size was too low to calculate size structure indices in 2006, but size structure was good with fish varying from 17 to 21 inches.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 18 inches by age six.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked every other year since 2000.  Despite regular stocking, the walleye population remains low, suggesting that walleye stocking is not making a noticeable contribution to the walleye fishery.   <br> 
 <br> 
The northern pike gill net catch was 3.0/net, which equaled the average for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have varied from 2.2 to 6.4/gill net.  Size structure was moderate with most fish between 17 and 26 inches.  Growth was similar to the statewide average for fish ages 1 to 3, and faster than the average for fish ages 4 to 6.  Northern pike averaged 30 inches by age six.  Northern pike may be growing faster once they are able to switch prey from a small population of yellow perch to larger, more abundant white suckers.   <br> 
 <br> 
The black crappie gill net catch was good with a catch rate of 4.0/gill net, which was within the range of expected values for similar lakes.  The trap net catch was 1.2/net, which was similar to the lower end of the range for similar lakes.  The high gill net catch was due to a large number of 4-inch black crappie sampled in the north basin.  Catch rates in past assessments varied from 0.2 to 8.0 fish/net for gill nets and 0.7 to 7.0 fish/net for trap nets.  Sample size was too low to calculate size structure indices, however, most fish were around 4 inches with a few larger fish up to 10 inches sampled.  Growth was slower than the statewide average with fish averaging 8 inches by age five.   <br> 
 <br> 
The bluegill trap net catch was 5.9/net and was similar to the average for similar lakes.  Catch rates in past assessments have varied from 1.6 to 9.4/trap net.  Size structure was poor with no fish sampled greater than 8 inches.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 6.8 inches at age seven.   <br> 
  <br> 
Yellow perch gill net catch was 2.3/net, which was similar to the lower end of the expected range.  Catch rates in past assessments have varied from 2.3 to 21.2/gill net.  Size structure was poor with no fish larger than 6.5 inches sampled.  Growth was similar to the statewide average. <br> 
 <br> 
Other fish sampled include: rock bass, white sucker, pumpkinseed sunfish, Johnny darter, bluntnose minnow, common shiner, golden shiner, spottail shiner, and tadpole madtom.     <br> 
 <br> 
The 2006 assessment was a full survey, which included vegetation sampling, and substrate and spawning area descriptions.  Vegetation sampling described the abundance of 54 different aquatic and riparian plant species.  Substrate was primarily sand with lesser amounts of boulder, rubble, gravel, and muck.  Spawning habitat was rated fair for walleye and good for black crappie, northern pike, bluegill and largemouth bass. <br>

 Survey Date = '2010-08-30',  County Name = 'St. Louis', Lake Name = 'Dinham' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 09/09/2010 Clarity: 4.1' 
 Narrative = '<p>Dinham is a 207 acre lake located 2 miles south of Melrude, MN on County Road 59. There is a DNR administered public access in the northeast bay off of Township Road 542.  Maximum depth is 25 feet, with 64% of the lake less than 15 feet deep.  Dinham was last assessed in 2002.  Dinham was surveyed during the summer of 2010 to update information about fish populations.   <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye abundance of 0.2 per gillnet lift was down from 2002 (0.7) and was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  The walleye gillnet has historically been low on Dinham and has ranged from 0.0 in 1972 to 1.0 in 1957 and 1978.  Walleye average length was extraordinary at over 27 inches but only two individuals were captured.  Not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.  Two year-classes were represented, 1999 and 2001.  Both year-classes correlate to years that walleye fry were stocked before the discontinuation of stocking in 2001. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike abundance of 1.3 per gillnet lift was down from 2002 and average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length was 24.8 inches, but not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.  All year-classes from 2005 to 2008 were represented. <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie abundance of 1.3 per trapnet lift was up from 2002 (2.1) and was below average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length was 7.1 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 to 2007 were represented.   <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill abundance of 10.2 per trapnet lift was up from 2002 (6.4) and was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of sampled bluegills was 5.2 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2003 to 2007 were represented.   <br> 
 <br> 
A total of 53 largemouth bass were sampled with electrofishing equipment.  The catch rate of largemouth bass was 72.7 fish per hour of electrofishing.  The 2002 largemouth bass electrofishing catch rate was 16.6 fish per hour.  Largemouth bass average length was 12.4 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2001 through 2007 were represented.   <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch abundance of 0.7 per gillnet lift was down from 2002 (1.0) and was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of perch was 5.4 inches, but not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.  Perch from the 2006 and 2008 year-classes were present. <br> 
 <br> 
Other fish species sampled included brown and yellow bullhead, golden shiner, pumpkinseed and white sucker.  <br> 
 <br> 
Information was collected on aquatic vegetation, substrate and water quality.  Thirty-five aquatic plant species or species groups were identified along 20 transects.  Large-leaf pondweed and flat-stem pondweed were the most frequently found plant species (90% of transects) followed by variable-leaf pondweed (85% of transects).  The most common substrate types were sand and gravel which were identified along 70% and 50% of the transects, respectively.  Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Dinham is an alkaline, moderately hard water lake with moderate fertility. <br> 
 <br> 
Dinham was included in an index of biotic integrity (IBI) assessment in 2010.  In addition to standard gillnets and trapnets, beach seines and backpack electrofishing equipment were used to index species richness of the nearshore lake habitat.</p>'

 Survey Date = '2016-06-13',  County Name = 'St. Louis', Lake Name = 'Elbow' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/14/2016 Clarity: 11.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Elbow Lake is a 169 acre lake located southwest of the city of Virginia.  It is accessed by an earthen ramp on the southwest side of the lake.  It has a maximum depth of 22 feet and green colored water.  On June 14, 2016 the surface temperature was 66 F and the bottom was 52 F.  Oxygen levels were adequate for gamefish to a depth of 14 feet.  Past dissolved oxygen checks in the winter have shown at times the lake does experience low oxygen levels under the ice.  

Elbow Lake is sparsely populated with homes and just over half of the shoreline is in public ownership.  Most of the upland areas of the shorelines are wooded.  A large part of the lake is surrounded with a fringe of cattail.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Elbow Lake are mostly sand and muck with a few areas of rubble and gravel.  Other than the cattail fringe, vegetation is fairly sparse and only grows to a depth of four feet.  

Elbow Lake has two inlets: one originates from a small lake to the north and the other is Elbow Creek which originates near Eveleth.  Elbow Creek has a history of receiving sewage effluent from the city of Eveleth.  During unusually wet weather events, Eveleth's treatment facility at times is unable to completely keep up and partially treated overflow can make its way into the creek.  The most recent events occurred in the spring of 2014 and 2016 where partially treated effluent was able to enter the creek and lake.  This excess nutrient load can supplement the natural nutrient load and at times cause strong algae blooms which creates the lakes green appearance.  The only outlet (Elbow Creek) flows south to the St. Louis River.  

This survey used gill nets, trap nets, and night electrofishing to assess the fish population.  Fish species sampled included northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, yellow perch, walleye, white sucker, pumpkinseed, golden shiner, and tadpole madtom.  

The northern pike gillnet catch was 15.5 fish/net which is comparable to other surveys from the lake and very good compared to other similar lakes in the state.  Sizes ranged from 18 to 36 inches with an average of 23 inches and three pounds.  Sizes were larger in this survey than any other survey on the lake.  

Electrofishing was used for the first time on Elbow Lake to sample largemouth bass.  Two and a half hours of electrofishing captured 36 largemouth for a catch rate of 14.4 fish/hour, which is slightly below average compared to other lakes in the area.  Sizes ranged from 3 to 18 inches with an average of 12 inches.  The average weight was one and a half pounds.  It appears Elbow Lake has the ability to grow some big largemouth with just over a third of the fish measuring larger than 16 inches.  Growth rates were extremely fast with a four year old bass averaging 14 inches long.  

The black crappie trapnet catch was 23.3 fish/net which is very good compared to other similar lakes and the highest catch rate on record for Elbow Lake.  Lengths ranged from 4 to 13 inches but the average was just over 5 inches.  Although the catch included a lot of small fish which brought the average size down, there were a lot of sizes that would be appealing to anglers.  Forty-six crappie measured larger than 8.5 inches.  As with the largemouth, the growth rates were extremely fast.  The average length of a four year old crappie was 10 inches long.  

This is only the second survey that sampled bluegill from Elbow Lake, the first record was from 1998 when one fish was captured.  The 2016 trapnet catch rate was 14.3 fish/net which is above average compared to other similar lakes.  Sizes were from 3 to 9 inches with a 6 inch average.  Just under half of the bluegill sampled were over 6.5 inches long.  As with largemouth and crappie, the growth rates for bluegill are quite fast compared to other lakes in the area.    

The yellow perch gillnet catch rate was 6.2 fish/net which is above average compared to other similar lakes.  Sizes were small though with an average length of 6 inches and the largest reaching just under 8 inches.    

Noticeable by their absence were black bullhead.  Black bullhead dominated catches in both gill nets and trap nets in the past three surveys with high marks of 144/gill net and 333/trap net in 1998.  It's not entirely known what happened to have such a die-off of this highly tolerable species, when the lake appears to be doing fairly well for other game species.

Other species sampled but in low numbers were one walleye, white sucker, golden shiner, pumpkinseed, and tadpole madtom.

Some smaller sized northern pike were infested with neascus (black spot) although the bluegill were all relatively clean.

 Survey Date = '2013-07-22',  County Name = 'St. Louis', Lake Name = 'Elbow' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/12/2013 Clarity: 6.8' 
 Narrative = '<p>Elbow is a 1,659 acre, class 7 lake located 7 miles SE of Orr, MN.  Maximum depth is approximately 60 feet and 40 percent of the lake is less than 15 feet deep.  The water is bog-stained and infertile.  Bass, Northern Pike, Panfish, and Walleye dominate the sport-fish community, but the various fisheries investigations on Elbow Lake have generally indicated low abundance. <br> 
 <br> 
Fisheries management has primarily focused on species introductions and maintenance stocking.  From 1933 to 1955 fry (Walleye) and fingerlings (Smallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass and Crappie) were stocked in small numbers.  Nine times between 1957 and 1980 Walleye fry or frylings were stocked with limited success.  Beginning in 1977 until present, Walleye fingerlings were stocked on a biennial basis with better results and more contributions to recruitment.  <br> 
 <br> 
Black Crappie trap-net abundance was below the normal range for this lake class.  Length in trap nets ranged from 4.6 to 7.7 inches and the mean was 6.3.  Only three year-classes were present and age ranged from 2 to 4.  Eighty-eight percent of the sample was from the 2010 and 2011 year-classes.  Only a small sample of fish were available for determining growth rate, but it appeared to be well below the area mean; which was not surprising as Elbow Lake has a history of slow-growing Black Crappie.  The mean weight was 0.14 pounds, which was below the normal range for this lake class.   <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill trap-net abundance was near the top of the normal range for this lake class.  Abundance was a slight decrease from the record set during previous investigation, but was still the second highest value ever recorded for Elbow Lake.  Mean length in trap nets was 6.3 inches with a range from 3.2 to 8.9.   Many year-classes were present and age ranged from 2 to 8.  Thirty-seven percent of the Bluegill captured in trap nets were from the 2008 year-class.  Growth was below the area average.  The mean weight was 0.22 pounds, which was within the normal range for this lake class.  <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike gill-net abundance was below the normal range for this lake class, but within the range observed in Elbow Lake since the mid 1980's.  Length ranged from 20.0 to 34.7 inches and the mean was 26.3.  The mean weight was 4.40 pounds, which was well above the normal range for lake class 7.   <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye gill-net abundance was below the normal range for class 7 lakes, but was within the range historically observed in Elbow Lake.  Mean length was 12.9 inches with a range from 7.1 to 19.3.  Six year-classes were present and age ranged from 1-9 years.  Age-5 fish were the most prominent and represented 39 percent of sample.  Ninety-three percent of the Walleyes that were aged were from years that were stocked.  Elbow Lake has benefitted from fingerling stocking; natural reproduction is likely not enough to maintain an acceptable sport-fishery.  In 2012, growth was much lower than the area mean.  The mean weight was 0.81 pounds, which was within the normal range for class 7 lakes.  <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch gill-net abundance was well below the normal range for this lake type and the second lowest level ever observed in Elbow Lake.  Abundance has generally been low for several decades.  In 2013, mean length in gill nets was 7.3 inches with a range from 5.7 to 8.7.  Growth was similar to the area mean.  Four year-classes were present and age ranged from 3-7 years.  The mean weight was within the normal range for this lake type.  <br>

 Survey Date = '2011-08-15',  County Name = 'St. Louis', Lake Name = 'Elliot' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/15/2011 Clarity: 8.2' 
 Narrative = '<p>Elliot is a 373-acre lake with 100% littoral area and a maximum depth of 13 feet. The lake is located near Central Lakes, MN and has a state owned, back in access on the west side of the lake.  Elliot was last assessed in 2003.  Elliot was surveyed during the summer of 2011 to update information about fish populations and aquatic habitat.   <br> 
 <br> 
A total of 15 largemouth bass were sampled with electrofishing equipment.  The catch rate of largemouth bass was 25.0 fish per hour of electrofishing on-time.  Previous catch rates have ranged from 14.8 to 34.8 per hour of electrofishing on-time.  Largemouth bass average length was 13.5 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 through 2007 were represented in the sample.  Eleven young-of-the-year (YOY) largemouth bass were captured during shoreline seining.   <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill abundance of 7.1 per trapnet lift was down from 2003 (12.1) and was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of sampled bluegills was 5.7 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 to 2009 were represented.  Four YOY bluegill were captured during shoreline seining. <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie abundance of 1.9 per trapnet lift was up from 2003 (0.0) and was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length was 7.9 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2003 to 2007 were represented.  Seven YOY black crappie were captured during shoreline seining. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike abundance of 9.1 per gillnet lift was down from 2003 (10.1) but remained above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length was 18.4 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  A total of 17 northern pike were also captured in the trapnets, with fish up to 40.6 inches captured.  All year-classes from 2002 to 2010 were represented except 2003, with strong 2006 and 2008 year-classes. <br> 
 <br> 
Two large walleye were captured in the trapnets, one each aged from the 1997 and 1999 year-classes.  Walleye stocking was discontinued in 1991 due to poor survival of stocked fish.  Limited natural reproduction has been documented, but the lack of any young walleye during this survey suggests that recent natural reproduction attempts have failed.    <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch abundance of 0.3 per gillnet lift was down from 2003 (3.0) and was below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of perch was 7.3 inches but not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.  Perch from the 2005, 2007 and 2008 year-classes were represented.  Fifty-four YOY yellow perch were captured during shoreline seining. <br> 
 <br> 
Other fish species sampled included black and brown bullhead, tadpole madtom, central mudminnow, Iowa darter, Johnny darter, blacknose shiner, golden shiner, common shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker.    <br> 
 <br> 
Information was collected on aquatic vegetation, substrate and water quality.  Forty-two aquatic plant species or species groups were identified along 20 transects.  Flat-stem pondweed, large-leaf pondweed and northern milfoil were the most frequently found plants (90%, 90% and 85% of the transects, respectively).  The most common substrate types were muck, sand and gravel which were identified along 60%, 60% and 35% of the transects, respectively.  Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Elliot is a slightly acidic, moderately hard water lake with moderate fertility. <br> 
 <br> 
Elliot Lake was included in an index of biotic integrity (IBI) assessment in 2011.  In addition to standard gillnets and trapnets, beach seines and backpack electrofishing equipment were used to index species richness of the nearshore lake habitat.</p>'

 Survey Date = '2016-09-06',  County Name = 'St. Louis', Lake Name = 'Eugene' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 09/06/2016 Clarity: 10.6' 
 Narrative = '<p>Eugene Lake is located near the border between Minnesota and the Province of Ontario and within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness about 13 miles northeast of Crane Lake, MN.  The lake is 181 acres with a maximum depth of 64 feet.  The lake has a rocky irregular shoreline and contains stained water with low fertility, typical of Canadian Shield lakes.  The Forest Service maintains several campsites on the lake and portage trails to surrounding lakes.  <br> 
 <br> 
Nine species were caught during the 2016 survey.  Northern Pike and White Sucker were the most common species in the gill net catch.  Yellow Perch and Hybrid Sunfish were the most common species captured in the special trap nets.   <br> 
 <br> 
Lake Whitefish provide an interesting option for anglers visiting Eugene Lake.  Abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  The three fish captured were all very similar in size; mean length was 17.8 inches.  The mean weight was 1.98 pounds, which was within the expected range for this lake type.    <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  The largest fish in the sample was 25.2 inches.  The mean weight was 1.74 pounds, which was near the lower end of the expected range for this lake type.     <br> 
 <br> 
Smallmouth Bass is another choice for anglers visiting Eugene Lake.  Few were captured in our nets, but anglers reported catching good numbers and sizes to the survey crew.    <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch abundance was within the expected range for this lake type.  However, sizes were small (only up to six inches).  Yellow Perch are likely more important as forage for predators rather than recreational fish for anglers in Eugene Lake.</p>'

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2007-06-07',  County Name = 'St. Louis', Lake Name = 'Fenske' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/07/2007 Clarity: 11' 
 Narrative = '<p>Fenske Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 10, which consists of 76 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small and have very soft (unmineralized) water.  Fenske Lake has clearer water and a more irregular shoreline shape than most of the lakes in this lake class.  Fenske Lake ranks as mesotrophic-to-eutrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index. <br> 
 <br> 
Fenske Lake was thermally stratified on 06/07/2007 with a surface temperature of 63 F and a bottom temperature of 42 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was present to a depth of 33 ft, where the temperature was 43 F. Fenske Lake has three inlets; two drain local swamps and the third, from Little Sletten Lake, has beaver dams that limit fish movement.  The outlet, to Everett Lake, also has beaver dams that limit fish movement. Aquatic plant growth is sparse in the main basin of Fenske Lake, primarily because the shoreline is rocky and drops off quickly.  Aquatic plant growth is lush in the shallow east and west ends of the lake, where they grow to a depth of 9 ft; watershield, waterlilies, floatingleaf burreed, and bladderwort are the most common plants.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Fenske Lake are mostly ledge rock, boulder, and rubble in the main basin, and muck or silt in the shallow east and west ends. <br> 
 <br> 
There is a public access with a gravel boat ramp off the Echo Trail (CSAH 116), and portages to Little Sletten and Everett Lakes.  About a third of the shoreline of Fenske Lake is in private ownership, primarily along the north shore.  Riparian development increased from one resort with 12 cabins, a girl scout camp, and a U.S. Forest Service campground in 1960; to one resort with 7 cabins, the Forest Service campground, and 6 private cabins in 1979; and to two resorts with 9 cabins, the Forest Service campground (with 16 campsites), and 7 private cabins in 2007.  <br> 
 <br> 
Fish sampling in the 2007 fisheries lake survey was done with six gillnets, nine standard trapnets, and four small mesh (1/4" bar) trapnets used for catching small fish.  Nine previous fisheries investigations, dating back to 1960, used 3-6 gillnets and 2-10 trapnets.  Most of these investigations were done in July or August, but the 2007 investigation was done in June due to scheduling considerations and because panfish are more easily captured early in the summer.  Most of the trapnets were set in the shallow east and west basins of the lake, while the gillnets were set in the deeper main basin of the lake. <br> 
 <br> 
The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 2007 of 3 fish/net (6 lb/net) was in the first quartile for this lake class and was similar to the median total catch of 5 fish/net (8 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  Lake Class 10 is one of the least productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of gillnet catches of fish.  The gillnet catch in 2007, as in previous investigations on this lake, was dominated by northern pike. <br> 
 <br> 
The total catch of fish in the trapnets in 2007 of 24 fish/net (10 lb/net) was very similar to the median total catch in all investigations on this lake of 21 fish/net (4 lb/net).  The trapnet catch in 2007, as in previous investigations on this lake, was dominated by bluegill sunfish. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike numbers in 2007 (2.3/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class, but were higher than the median catch of 1.2/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Fair numbers of pike (2.4/net) were also caught in the trapnets in 2007.  Pike sizes in the gillnets averaged 22.6" (2.6 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class, but was smaller than the average size of 28.6" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike in 2007, caught in a trapnet, was 32.9".  Pike growth was normal by area standards. <br> 
  <br> 
Bluegill numbers in 2007 (18.7/trapnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class, and were similar to the median catch of 16.3/trapnet in all investigations on this lake. Bluegill sizes in 2007 averaged 6.4" (0.2 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average bluegill size of 5.8" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest bluegill in 2007 was 8.7".  Most bluegill were ages five and six, and fair numbers of young-of-year bluegill were caught in the small mesh trapnets.  Bluegill growth was slower than normal (in the first or second quartile, depending on the age) by area standards. <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie numbers in 2007 (1.4/trapnet), as in previous investigations, were quite low.  Large crappie (up to 12") were caught in most investigations on this lake, but the largest crappie in 2007 was 10.8".   <br> 
 <br> 
Bass populations in Fenske Lake are likely more abundant than indicated by the net catches.  Bass are "net-shy" and tend to avoid standard sampling nets.  Some young-of-year largemouth were captured in the small mesh trapnets in 2007. <br> 
  <br> 
Most of the game fish examined in 2007 were free of diseases or parasites.  A few bluegill were infected with neascus.  Neascus (black spot) is a common parasite that is native to the area.  It cannot infect humans, is often removed by filleting fish, and is killed at temperatures used to cook fish. </p>'

 Survey Date = '2010-09-13',  County Name = 'St. Louis', Lake Name = 'Harris' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 09/13/2010 Clarity: 10.8' 
 Narrative = '<p>Harris Lake is a 67 acre lake within Superior National Forest with 44 (65%) acres of littoral area and a maximum depth of 38 feet.  The lake is located east of Whiteface Reservoir.  The lake is accessible by a rugged 3/4 mile long trail off of the Northeast Grade.  Walleye fingerlings have been stocked in odd years since 2003.  Harris Lake was last assessed in 2003.  Harris was surveyed during 2010 to update information about fish populations and to evaluate the success of the walleye stocking program.  <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye abundance of 3.7 per gillnet lift was up from 2003 (1.7) and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye average length was 15.1 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 to 2009 were represented except 2004, 2005 and 2006.  One exceptionally old individual was captured from the 1989 year-class.  Seventy percent of the walleyes aged were from the 2007 year-class.  Ninety-three percent of the walleyes aged corresponded to stocked year-classes.   <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike abundance of 1.8 per gillnet lift was up from 2003 (0.5) and average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Historically, the northern pike CPUE has been low in Harris and has ranged from 0.3 (1996) to 4.0 (1974).  Average length was good at 28.6 inches and growth was very fast compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Growth rates of northern pike from Harris are currently the fastest documented in the Duluth Area.  All year-classes from 2004 to 2007 were represented, with one exceptionally large fish (45 inches) from the 2000 year-class sampled. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill abundance of 23.4 per trapnet lift was up from 2003 (12.4) and average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of sampled bluegills was 4.9 inches and growth was slow compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2001 to 2007 were represented.  Special 1/4" trapnets captured 1 YOY bluegill with a length of 1.0 inch. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch abundance of 37.3 per gillnet lift was up substantially from 2003 (2.8) and was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of perch was 6.4 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Perch from all year-classes from 2003 through 2009 were represented, except 2008.  The 2005 and 2006 year-classes were strong, contributing to 92% of the overall sample size.  Special 1/4" trapnets captured 1 YOY yellow perch with a length of 1.9 inches.   <br> 
 <br> 
Other fish species sampled included blacknose shiner, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker.    <br> 
 <br> 
Information was collected on aquatic vegetation, substrate and water quality.  Twenty-three aquatic plant species or species groups were identified along 10 transects.  Bushy pondweed, large-leaf pondweed and sweetgale were the most frequently found plant species (90% of transects) followed by floating-leaf pondweed, ribbon-leaf pondweed and the sedge group (80% of transects).  The most common substrate types were boulder, rubble and detritus which were identified along 100%, 80% and 60% of the transects, respectively.  Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Harris is an alkaline, moderately soft water lake with low fertility.   <br>

 Lake Clarity = '' 
 Narrative = '<p>Horseshoe Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 19, which consists of 66 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, shallow, and have moderately hard (mineralized) water.  Horseshoe Lake has clearer water than many of the lakes in this lake class.According to Carlson's Trophic State Index, Horseshoe Lake ranks as mesotrophic with a Secchi water clarity of 3.4 m, total phosphorus at or below the detection limit of 20 ppb, and chlorophyll-a of 6.1 ppb.  Summer algae blooms have declined in recent years, according to a local resident in 2002.  Horesehoe Lake was slightly thermally stratified on 07/01/2002 with a surface temperature of 79 F and a bottom temperature of 68 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 10 ft, where the temperature was 69 F.One small inlet is from Mud Lake.  The outlet to Long Lake is shallow, but navigable by canoe or small boat.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Horseshoe Lake are mostly sand, with some gravel and muck.  Aquatic plants are abundant in a fringe around the entire shoreline and grow to a depth of 6 ft; the most common plants are coontail and yellow waterlily.  Other common plants are filamentous algae, northern milfoil, duckweed, flat-stem pondweed, bulrush, and cattail.  Curly-leaf pondweed was present in 2002 and has been present in adjacent Long Lake for several years.  It is not native to this area, and was not observed in previous fisheries lake surveys in 1959 and 1977.There is no public access to Horseshoe Lake.  The 2002 fisheries lake survey crew used a private access.  There were 23 homes and cabins on the lake in 2002.  A central sewer collector was installed around Long Lake in 2001 and comes close to some of the homes on Horseshoe Lake; three year-round homes and one seasonal cabin on Horseshoe Lake are now connected to this sewer collector.Fish sampling in this investigation consisted of  two gillnet sets and nine trapnet sets.  Small mesh (1/4") trapnets were used in lieu of shoreline seining due to the thick vegetation along the shoreline.  Three previous investigations dating back to 1959 each consisted of 2-3 gillnets and 4 trapnets.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the trapnets in 2002 of 57.8 fish/net (18.2 lb/net) was similar to the median catch of 68.8 fish/net (24.9 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  The trapnet catch in 2002 was dominated by bluegill and black crappie.The total catch of fish in the gillnets in 2002 of 22.5 fish/net (33.3 lb/net) was in the second quartile for this lake class and was similar to the median catch of 24.8 fish/net (38.0 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  The gillnet catch in 2002 was dominated by northern pike.Bluegill numbers in 2002 (48.0/trapnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class.  Bluegill numbers appear to have increased over time from an average of 14/trapnet in the first two investigations, to an average of 40/trapnet in the two most recent investigations.  However, the first two investigations were done in late August and early September, while the two most recent investigations were done in early July.  Sunfish are more likely to be caught in trapnets early in the summer.  Bluegill sizes in 2002 averaged 6.2" (0.20 lb), which was near the median for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 5.6" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest bluegill in 2002 was 9.9", and three percent were 8" or larger.  Growth of bluegill was in the second quartile for young fish and in the third quartile for older fish, by area standards.Black crappie numbers in 2002 (5.8/trapnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were similar to the median catch of 6.2/trapnet in all investigations on this lake.  Crappie sizes in 2002 averaged 9.5" (0.50 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was larger than the average size of 7.7" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest crappie was 12.2".   Most crappie in 2002 (62%) were four years old, from a strong 1998 year class.  Growth of crappie was faster than normal (in the third and fourth quartiles, depending on age) by area standards.Northern pike numbers in 2002 (11.5/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class and were higher than the median catch of 8.5/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2002 averaged 21.2" (2.4 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class and was smaller than the average size of 23.5" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike was 33.8".  Growth of pike was near the median by area standards.Many of the bluegill and northern pike examined in 2002 were infected with neascus.  Some of the perch were infected with yellow grub.  Neascus (black spot) and yellow grub are common parasites that are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>'

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/09/2008 Clarity: 5.8' 
 Narrative = '<p>Iron Chief Complex is a series of three abandoned mine pits (now connected) near the town of Buhl.  Like most pit lakes, the water is relatively infertile and clear.  Rainy and windy weather occasionally loosens sediment from the pit walls causing the water to cloud up temporarily.  There is a city-owned public access on the south side of the lake.  DNR Fisheries has done no stocking or management of the lake, and the 2008 assessment was the first ever conducted on the pit. <br> 
 <br> 
Very few fish were captured in the test nets.  Green sunfish was the most numerous species in the standard assessment gears, at 1.2/gill net and 1.2/trap net.  These fish were rather small, ranging from 3.7 to 5.6 inches in length.  Four rainbow smelt were also captured in the gill nets for a catch rate of 0.7/net. <br> 
 <br> 
Two small-mesh gill nets specifically designed to sample small fish such as rainbow smelt were also used in this assessment.  A total of 32 smelt were captured for a catch rate of 16/net.  These fish ranged from 4.6 to 6.3 inches in length.     <br> 
 <br> 
One northern pike (28.4 inches) was captured in a trap net.  This was the only large predator fish sampled.  Other fish sampled in low numbers were black bullhead, black crappie, blacknose shiner, bluegill and white sucker.  Good water quality characteristics and the presence of a modest population of rainbow smelt appear to make Iron Chief Complex suitable for a cold-water species such as lake trout. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2015-08-17',  County Name = 'St. Louis', Lake Name = 'Island' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/17/2015 Clarity: 14.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Island Lake is a 227 acre lake located 14 miles south of Hibbing, MN in the St. Louis River watershed.  Island Lake has clear, moderately hard water with low phosphorus fertility.  The variety of substrate types and aquatic vegetation provides good habitat for Northern Pike, Largemouth Bass and panfish.  While most of the shoreline is in private ownership, the island was acquired by the DNR as an Aquatic Management Area that allows public use for picnicking, hiking and other day uses.  A standard lake survey was conducted in August 2015 to update information on the fish population and evaluate walleye fingerling stocking.  <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike numbers were within the expected range and similar to the long-term average for the lake.  Size structure was moderate; sampled pike averaged 21.0 inches and 2.2 pounds, although one pike over 36 inches was captured.  Age 3-4 pike made up the majority of the sample, with only one fish exceeding age 5.  Growth was similar to the statewide average with fish averaging 24.0 inches at age 5.  The general lack of fish over 24 inches and five years of age may be a result of harvest by anglers.  Anglers can help improve the quality of the Northern Pike population by practicing selective harvest of fish under 22 inches, while releasing medium to large fish.  Releasing these fish can help maintain a more balanced fish community and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more large fish in the future. <br> 
 <br> 
The spring night electrofishing assessment showed a moderately abundant Largemouth Bass population.  Size structure was modest; sampled bass averaged 12.8 inches and 1.2 pounds.  Age analysis suggested consistent recruitment with many year classes represented.  Growth was relatively slow with Largemouth Bass averaging 12.8 inches at age 6. <br> 
 <br> 
Black Crappie were the most common fish in the gill nets with numbers well above the expected range.  Size structure was considered poor since a majority of the sample was age 1 to 3 fish measuring less than 8 inches.  Angling opportunities for crappie should improve in the next few years as these young fish grow to more favorable sizes.  Growth of Island Lake crappie is relatively slow with crappie averaging 9.6 inches at age 6.   <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye numbers in Island Lake have generally been low, and fingerling stocking appears to contribute little to the fishery.  Gill-nets sampled only one Walleye in 2015, despite fingerling stocking in two of the previous five years.  Fingerling stocking will likely be discontinued, since lake conditions seem to favor other species such as Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass.   <br> 
 <br> 
Other species sampled in test nets included Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Yellow Perch and Golden Shiner. <br>

 Survey Date = '2013-07-29',  County Name = 'St. Louis', Lake Name = 'Janette' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/29/2013 Clarity: 3.8' 
 Narrative = '<p>Janette Lake is located about 9 miles northeast of Goodland, MN.  The lake is in ecological lake class #13 and located in the St. Louis River Watershed.  Janette Lake is 137 acres, has a littoral area of 119 acres (87%) and a maximum depth of 23 feet.  The lake has soft water and moderate fertility.  <br> 
 <br> 
The Lake Management Plan (LMP) was last revised in 2004.  Walleye and black crappie were the primary management species and northern pike and largemouth bass were secondary species.   <br> 
 <br> 
A resurvey was conducted in 2013 to collect detailed information about Janette Lake, determine the status of the fish community, and evaluate the usefulness of fingerling stocking.  The assessment included spring electrofishing for largemouth bass. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike were the most common fish in the gill net sample.  The catch rate was the highest recorded for Janette Lake, but similar to lakes with similar habitats.  Size structure was poor, as pike ranged from 15.8 to 22.2 inches.  Pike averaged 16.0 inches.  Age analysis of bony structures identified three year classes (1-3).  Northern pike populations are often dominated by age 2-5 pike, and age distribution from Janette was unusual.  The lack of older, larger pike may indicate poor past recruitment, high adult mortality, or a combination of both.  Growth was near the statewide average, as pike typically attained 18 inches by age 3.   Poor size structure likely limits the popularity of the pike fishery. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye were the second most common fish in the gill net sample.  The catch rate was within the typical compared to similar lakes, but was above average for Janette Lake.  Length ranged from 7.8 to 20.6 inches and walleye averaged 15.8 inches.  Age analysis identified four year classes (ages 1-3 and age 5).  All but one walleye corresponded to a stocked year.  Growth was near the statewide average with walleye typically attaining 17 inches by age 5.    <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappies were caught in low numbers by trap nets, but the gill net catch was typical for the lake type.  Summer trap netting may be a poor indicator of crappie abundance in Janette Lake.  The size structure was poor, as few crappies exceeded 8 inches.   Black crappie populations often exhibit irregular recruitment resulting in dominant year classes, shifting age and size structures, and inconsistent angler success.  Six year classes were identified and recruitment was inconsistent as most fish belonged to the 2010 and 2011 year classes.  Growth was near the statewide average with crappie exceeding 8 inches by age 4 and 10 inches by age 6.  Good crappie fishing may periodically exist. <br> 
 <br> 
The bluegill catch was typical compared to similar lakes, but below average for Janette Lake.  Size structure was moderate.  Lengths ranged from 3.2 to 8.7 inches with an average length of 6.7 inches.  Nine year classes were identified and recruitment appeared consistent.  Growth was near the lake class average with bluegill exceeding 6 inches by age 5.  <br> 
  <br> 
Largemouth bass were captured by electrofishing in early June.  The catch rate suggests that bass are common in Janette Lake.  Size structure was moderate, as largemouth bass ranged from 7.5 to 16.9 inches and bass averaged 13.6 inches.  Growth was near the statewide average as bass typically exceeded 12 inches by age 5.  Janette Lake should produce good bass fishing opportunities. <br> 
 <br> 
Other species captured included hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, and yellow bullhead.  It should be noted that yellow perch were present in past samples but were not captured in 2013.  <br> 
 <br> 
Janette Lake is not known to support invasive species.  Anglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.    <br>

 Narrative = '<p>Jorgens Lake is a 66 acre, 21-foot deep lake located on the Kabetogama Peninsula within the boundaries of Voyageurs National Park (VNP). The lake has a rocky shoreline and the immediate watershed is relatively steep and heavily forested. Waters within Jorgens are heavily stained and infertile. Jorgens is within VNP's proposed designated wilderness and as such motors are not allowed.  Access is via a 0.9-mile long portage trail from Ek Bay on Kabetogama Lake.  VNP maintains a campsite on the lake but not a rental boat.Northern pike were the most abundant species in the gill-net catch.  Pike numbers were high relative to other lakes in the same ecological classification but were slightly below the abundance recorded during the only previous investigation in 1971.  Pike sizes, however, have improved since 1971.  During the 2005 investigation, pike ranged from 13.0 to 27.4 inches with an average length of 22.9 inches. In 1971, all pike caught were less than 23.0 inches long and the average length was 18.9 inches.  Growth of Jorgens Lake pike is slow relative to other lakes in the International Falls Management Area.Largemouth bass were also captured in the 2005 Jorgens Lake investigation.  Although passive sampling gears like gill nets are not well suited for capturing bass, two fish between 13.0 and 16.0 inches were caught suggesting, at least a small, self-sustaining population.  Reports from anglers fishing in Jorgens Lake also indicate that there are fair to good numbers of quality sized bass in the lake.    </p>'

Kangas Lake is more bowl-shaped and has a lower water clarity (due to bog-stain) than many of the lakes in this lake class.  Kangas Lake ranks as eutrophic, according to Carlson's Trophic State Index.Kangas Lake was thermally stratified on 07/23/2002 with a surface temperature of 81 F and a bottom temperature of 52 F, and retained 2 ppm oxygen to a depth of only 3 ft, where the temperature was 74 F.  The inlet from Little Lake and the outlet to Birch Lake have barriers to fish movement (bogs, falls, beaver dams).  Bottom types in shallow water are detritus and muck.  The entire lake has a bog fringe and aquatic plants are those associated with bogs and muck.The shoreline along the northeast quarter of Kangas Lake is in a combination county tax-forfeit/private ownership.  The remainder of the shoreline is in Federal ownership.  There is no riparian development.  Access is via portage and paddling up the outlet creek from Birch Lake.  Fishing pressure is probably light.Fish sampling in the 2001 fisheries initial lake survey consisted of two standard gillnet sets and two metal minnow traps.  Trapnets were not used due to the difficult portage access, and shoreline seines were not used due to the lack of suitable seining areas.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 2001 of 8.0 fish/net (6.5 lb/net) was in the first quartile for this lake class.  Fish populations were very simple, consisting of only northern pike, yellow perch, and golden shiner.  Fish were captured at greater depths in the nets than would have been predicted by the poor oxygen levels.  Black crappie have reportedly been caught in this lake by anglers, but none were observed during the lake survey.Northern pike numbers (3.0/gillnet) were in the first quartile for this lake class.  Pike sizes averaged 20.2" (2.0 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class.  The largest pike was 28.9".  The six pike captured were from five different year classes.  Pike growth was slower than normal by area standards.Yellow perch numbers (3.5/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class.  Perch sizes averaged 6.0" (0.1 lb), which was in the first quartile for this lake class.  The largest perch was 6.6".  Growth of age two perch was normal by area standards, while growth of older perch was slower than normal.Golden shiner numbers (1.5/gillnet) were near the median for this lake class.

According to Carlson's Trophic State Index, Kelsey Lake ranks as mesotrophic with a Secchi water clarity of 2.2 m, and as eutrophic with a chlorophyll-a concentration of 11.3 ppb.  The total phosphorus reading was at or below the laboratory detection limit of 20 ppb, which ranks it somewhere between mesotrophic and oligotrophic.  The water color was green, indicating algal growth.Kelsey Lake was slightly thermally stratified on 09/11/2002 with a surface temperature of 72 F and a bottom temperature of 65 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (more than 2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 15 ft, where the temperature was 68 F.Kelsey Lake has no inlets.  The outlet to Lac La Croix flows through a marsh, has several beaver dams along its course, and has a steep gradient where it joins Lac La Croix.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly boulder, rubble, gravel, and silt.  Aside from planktonic algae, aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 10 ft.Fish sampling in this initial survey consisted of five gillnet sets.  Trapnets and shoreline seines were not used due to the difficult portage access to this lake.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in this lake of 25.4 fish/net (34.8 lb/net) was in the fourth quartile for this lake class.  Lake Class 10 is one of the least productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota, in terms of gillnet catches of fish.  Fish populations in Kelsey Lake were dominated by northern pike and white sucker.  Low numbers of pumpkinseed sunfish and yellow perch were also present.Northern pike numbers (21.0/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class.  Pike sizes averaged 18.2" (1.2 lb), which was in the first quartile for this lake class.  The largest pike was 26.8".  Most pike were ages 2-4.  Pike growth was slower than normal (in the first quartile) by area standards.  Pike stomachs contained young-of-year yellow perch (48%), unidentified fish remains (24%), crayfish (16%), and young-of-year northern pike, young-of-year sucker, pumpkinseed sunfish, and blacknose shiner (3% each).  About 20 percent of the pike were infected with neascus (black spot).  Neascus is a common parasite that is native to the area.  It cannot infect humans, is often removed by filleting, and is killed at temperatures used to cook fish.White sucker numbers in 2002 (3.6/gillnet) were in the third quartile for this lake class.

Walleye fingerlings have been stocked in even years since 2000. Leora was last assessed in 2003.  Leora was surveyed during the summer of 2011 to update information about fish populations and aquatic habitat and to evaluate the success of the walleye stocking program.  <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye abundance of 4.0 per gillnet lift was down from 2003 (9.2) and average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Walleye average length was 15.3 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Ten year-classes were present from 1995 through 2010, with a strong 2008 year-class.  Seventy-one percent of the walleyes aged corresponded to stocked year-classes.  Previous investigations have ranged from 50-100% correspondence of aged walleye to stocked year-classes.   <br>

Both largemouth and smallmouth bass were captured during the survey.  Although YOY largemouth bass were sampled during the 1964 survey, largemouth bass were not sampled again until the 2008 survey.  A total of five largemouth bass were caught in gillnets and three in trapnets.  Mean length was 10.9 inches from the gillnets, with fish up to 16.9 inches sampled.  Fall shoreline seining captured 7 YOY largemouth bass.  A total of nine smallmouth bass were caught in gillnets, up from eight caught in 1992, the first time smallmouth bass were sampled in Little Grand Lake.

 Narrative = '<p>Little Sturgeon Lake is located approximately 14 miles northwest of Chisholm, MN and within the Little Fork River Watershed.  The 247 acre lake has 54 littoral acres with a 22 foot maximum depth, and is moderately developed along the 3.6 mile shoreline.  A public access is located on the north side of the Sturgeon River between Little Sturgeon and Side Lake with parking for five rigs.  Little Sturgeon Lake is part of the larger Sturgeon Lake chain and outlets through the Sturgeon River to Side Lake.  There are inlets from both Sturgeon and South Sturgeon Lakes. Little Sturgeon Lake has low fertility and very soft water, both of which limit fish production.  <br> 
 <br> 
The 2010 Lake Management Plan (LMP) lists Black Crappie, Northern Pike and Walleye as primary species for management and Bluegill as a secondary species.  The LMP goals were to: maintain a Black Crappie trap net or gill net catch near 2.0/net; maintain a Northern Pike gill net catch near 5.0/net; maintain a Walleye gill net catch of 2.0/net and to maintain a Bluegill trap net catch near 12.0/net. <br> 
 <br> 
A standard survey was conducted in June of 2016 to assess the status and characteristics of the fish community using six gill nets and nine trap nets.   <br> 
 <br> 
Little Sturgeon Lake has a small Walleye population maintained by natural reproduction and/or immigration. Walleye fingerlings were stocked annually from 2005 - 2010 and in 2014 at a rate of 1 lb./littoral acre (54 lbs.) but did not appear to contribute to the fishery, as most captured walleye have been associated with non-stocked year classes.  Walleye were captured at a rate of 1.0/gill net, which is below what would be expected for lakes with similar habitats.  Gill net catch rates have been below the management goal of 2.0/gill net in five of six surveys conducted since 1984.  A total of six Walleye were captured in gill nets ranging in length from 13.6 to 18.2 inches with an average weight of 2.2 pounds.  Walleye growth was below the statewide average with an average length of 14.1 inches at age-4. Three year classes were represented in the sample, but only one fish corresponded to a year when the lake was stocked.   <br> 
 <br> 
The Northern Pike catch rate decreased from 7.3/gill net in 2009 to 4.3/gill net, which met the management goal. Little Sturgeon Lake has a history of relatively high pike abundance as gill net catches have been near the upper limit of what would be typical of lakes with similar habitats. Northern Pike captured in gill nets ranged in length from 16.2 - 34.0 inches with an average length of 20.4 inches.  Size structure in 2016 was poor as only one fish captured was greater than 28 inches in length.  However, Little Sturgeon Lake has the potential to produce larger Northern Pike as fish over 28 inches have been sampled in four of six surveys.  Anglers are encouraged to release Northern Pike greater than 22 inches to improve size quality.  Analysis of ageing structures identified four consecutive age classes, ages 3 - 6.  Northern Pike attained an average length of 18.8 inches at age-4, similar to that found in previous surveys.   <br> 
 <br> 
The Black Crappie catch rates of 2.3/trap net and 2.7/gill net both exceeded the management goals of 2.0/net.  Black Crappie gill and trap net catch rates have been variable in previous surveys, but typical of lakes with similar habitats in five of six surveys.  Size structure in 2016 was moderate as 17% of the Black Crappie measured were greater than 10 inches in length.  Growth appeared slower than both the 2009 survey and the statewide average, with an average length of 8.1 inches at age-5.  Six consecutive age classes (ages 2-7) were represented in the sample.  However, slow growth and harvest may be impacting size structure as only one Black Crappie over 12.0 inches has been sampled in six surveys.   <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill were captured at a rate of 7.8/trap net.  Bluegill trap net catch rates have been within the typical range for lakes with similar habitat in all surveys.  Bluegill size structure appears to have improved considerably as 26% of the Bluegill measured were greater than 8 inches in length, compared to 6% in 2009.   Management goals for both abundance and size structure were met. Seven consecutive age classes were represented in the sample, ages 3-9.  Bluegill growth was slow with an average length of 5.6 inches at age-6.   <br> 
 <br> 
The Yellow Perch catch rate of 4.7/gill net was similar to 4.5/gill net in 2009 and within the typical range for lakes with similar habitats.  The 2009 and 2016 gill net catch rates were the lowest observed in six surveys.  All Yellow Perch sampled were less than eight inches, and few over eight inches have been sampled in previous surveys.   <br> 
 <br> 
The Tullibee catch rate of 1.0/gill net was the lowest observed in any survey.  However, Tullibee have not been abundant historically as gill net catches in previous surveys have ranged from 1.4 - 4.3/net.   <br> 
 <br> 
Other species sampled included: Golden Redhorse, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish, Pumpkinseed Sunfish, Shorthead Redhorse, Silver Redhorse and White Sucker.   <br>

 Narrative = '<p>Long Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 11, which consists of 49 small lakes in northeast Minnesota that have moderately hard (mineralized) water.  Long Lake is typical of lakes in this lake class.According to Carlson's Trophic State Index, Long Lake ranks as mesotrophic (with Secchi water clarity of 2.75 m and chlorophyll-a of 4.2 ppb), and mesotrophic-to-eutrophic (with total phosphorus of 30 ppb).Long Lake was thermally stratified on 07/09/2002 with a surface temperature of 77 F and a bottom temperature of 48 F.  Adequate oxygen for fish (2 ppm) was retained to a depth of 13 ft, where the temperature was 70 F.The inlet from Horseshoe Lake and the outlet to the St. Louis River have no barriers to fish movement.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly sand, with some gravel and muck.  Aquatic plants are abundant along the entire shoreline and in the southwest bay.  The most abundant aquatic plants were coontail, northern milfoil, and filamentous algae.  Other common plants included waterlilies, white water buttercup, and several pondweeds (clasping-leaf, bushy, narrow- leaf, and flat-stem).  Curly-leaf pondweed has been present in Long Lake for several years.  It is not native to this area, and was not observed in previous fisheries lake surveys on this lake in 1955 and 1977.There is no public access to Long Lake, and most of the shoreline is heavily developed with 120 homes and cabins.  A central sewer collector system was recently installed around Long Lake, and most of the sewage mound systems have been abandoned.  The island is owned by the Knights of Kaleva, and the fisheries survey crew used this access to the lake.Fish sampling in this investigation consisted of four gillnet sets and nine trapnet sets.  Additional gillnets were not used due to the limited area with adequate oxygen outside of the shoreline vegetation fringe.  Shoreline seining and electrofishing was not done due to the heavy vegetation growth in the shoreline fringe.  Small mesh trapnets were used in lieu of the shoreline seining.  Three previous investigations on this lake dating back to 1955 consisted of 4-6 gillnet sets and 3-6 trapnet sets.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the trapnets in 2002 of 55.0 fish/net (10.4 lb/net) was similar to the median catch of 51.0 fish/net (13.0 lb/net) in all investigations on this lake.  The trapnet catch in 2002 was dominated by bluegill sunfish, followed by black crappie.  Other species were present in low numbers.The total catch of fish in the gillnets in 2002 of 23.0 fish/net was near the median for this lake class and was similar to the median catch of 28.5 fish/net in all investigations on this lake.  The total catch of fish by weight in 2002 of 53.8 lb/net was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was much higher than the median catch of 17.1 lb/net in all investigations on this lake.  The gillnet catch in 2002 was dominated by northern pike, followed by white sucker.  Other species were present in low numbers.Bluegill numbers in 2002 (46.8/trapnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class.  Bluegill numbers were much higher in the 1987 and 2002 investigations than in previous investigations in 1955 and 1977.  Bluegill sizes in 2002 averaged 5.3" (0.14 lb), which was near the first quartile for this lake class and was smaller than the average size of 5.6" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest bluegill in 2002 was 8.6".  Growth of bluegill captured in 2002 was slower than normal by area standards (in the first or second quartile, depending on the age).Northern pike numbers in 2002 (12.5/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class, and were much higher than the median catch of 2.4/gillnet in all investigations on this lake.  Pike sizes in 2002 averaged 25.1" (3.6 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class and was similar to the average size of 25.7" in all investigations on this lake.  The largest pike in 2002 was 31.7".  Although pike scales were rated as being easy to read, growth of pike captured in 2002 was erratic enough to lend suspicion on the accuracy of the ageing and to deny conclusions about the growth rates.Some of the black crappie captured in 2002 were large (up to 12").  Yellow perch numbers in 2002 were low, but had been high in the 1955 and 1987 investigations.  Good numbers of perch were caught in the small mesh trapnets in 2002.  Largemouth bass are probably more abundant than indicated by the standard gillnet and trapnet catches, and fair numbers of young largemouth were caught in the small mesh trapnets in 2002.  Bullhead were not captured in 2002, but were present in low numbers in previous investigations.Most of the game fish examined in 2002 were infected with neascus.  Many of the yellow perch were infected with yellow grub.  Neascus (black spot) and yellow grub are common parasites that are native to the area.  They cannot infect humans, are often removed by filleting, and are killed at temperatures used to cook fish.</p>'

Black Crappie trap-net abundance was below the expected range for this lake type.  However, the mean weight was 0.78 pounds, which was just above the normal range for this lake type.  Length in trap nets ranged from 8.9 to 13.0 inches and the mean was 11.0.  Black Crappie fishing has become popular, especially in late fall.  Most anglers have been attracted by the large Crappies present in Loon Lake.   <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike abundance exceeded the normal range for this lake type but size was small.  Length ranged from 15.3 to 25.7 inches and the mean was 20.6.  Growth and mean weight were below the expected range for this lake type.   <br> 
 <br> 
Smallmouth Bass is another choice for anglers visiting Loon Lake.  Abundance in 2015 was within expected range for this lake type.  Typically, anglers catch some very large fish while targeting Smallmouth Bass. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye abundance and mean weight were within the expected range for this lake type.  Length ranged from 7.2 to 21.2 inches and the mean was 12.5.  Eight year-classes were present and age ranged from 1 to 13.  The 2011 and 2012 year classes combined for 57 percent of the sample.     <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch were present but abundance was low and sizes were small.  Yellow Perch are likely more important as forage for predators rather than recreational fish for anglers.</p>'

Maxine Lake is smaller than most of the lakes in this lake class.  Maxine Lake ranks as mesotrophic-to-eutrophic according to Carlson's Trophic State Index using water clarity of 1.8 m, chlorophyll_a of 6 ppb, and total phosphorus of 26 ppb.Maxine Lake was thermally stratified on 07/02/2001 with a surface temperature of 71 F and a bottom temperature of 45 F, and retained 2 ppm oxygen to a depth of 11 ft, where the temperature was 57 F.  The inlet from Ole Lake and the outlet to Little Crab Lake (via Korb Creek) have low flows and barriers to fish movement (bogs and beaver dams).  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly boulder and rubble.  Aquatic plants grow to a depth of 8 ft and are scattered along the shoreline, with concentrations at the inlet and outlet and in the eastern bay.  Water shield, sweetgale, water bulrush, and cattail are the most common plants.Maxine Lake is in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness on a no-motor route.  There is one USFS campsite on the lake.This was the initial survey of Maxine Lake.  Fish populations in 2001 were sampled with two gillnet sets and two metal minnow traps.  Trapnets were not used due to the difficult portage access.  Shoreline seines were not used due to the lack of suitable seining areas on the lake.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 2001 of 18.5 fish/net (22.9 lb/net) was near the median for this lake class.  Fish populations consisted mostly of northern pike, white sucker, largemouth bass, and bluegill sunfish.  Other fish species were present in low numbers.Northern pike numbers (3.5/gillnet) were in the second quartile for this lake class.  Pike sizes averaged 23.4" (2.8 lb), which was in the fourth quartile for this lake class.  The largest pike was 27.4".  Pike from five year classes were captured.  Pike growth appeared to be slower than normal by area standards.White sucker numbers (4.5/gillnet) were near the median for this lake class.  Sucker sizes averaged 16.5" (1.9 lb), which was in the third quartile for this lake class.Largemouth bass numbers (3.5/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class.  Bass sizes averaged 11.9" (0.9 lb), which was at the median for this lake class.  The largest bass was 14.6".  Only two year classes of bass were caught, ages four and six.  Bass growth was normal by area standards.Bluegill numbers (4.0/gillnet) appeared to be high, although quartiles have not been developed for bluegill catches in gillnets for this lake class.  Bluegill sizes averaged 6.0" (0.1 lb); the largest bluegill was 7.4". </p>'

 Survey Date = '2013-07-22',  County Name = 'St. Louis', Lake Name = 'McQuade' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/22/2013 Clarity: 4' 
 Narrative = '<p>McQuade Lake is a small lake located about eight miles east of Hibbing, MN off County Road #592.  The lake is included in ecological lake class 19.  Lakes in this class are small and shallow with moderately hard water.   McQuade Lake is 164 acres with a littoral area of 157 acres (96%) and a maximum depth of 21 feet.  It has very hard water (alkalinity=148) and high phosphorus fertility (0.071 ppm).  The water has a slight bog stain and Secchi disk readings of four to five feet.  The lake receives water from a creek flowing from Buhl, MN and outlets to the St. Louis River.  <br> 
 <br> 
The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has calculated a Carlson Trophic Status Index of 59 from data collected from 2003 to 2012, indicating a eutrophic state (cf.pca.state.mn.us).  Eutrophic lakes often produce algae blooms that may be a nuisance for land owners and recreators.  MPCA listed the overall condition as "Not always suitable for swimming and wading due to low clarity or excessive algae caused by the presence of nutrients such as phosphorus in the water". <br> 
 <br> 
The fisheries lake management plan (LMP) was last revised in 2002.  The goals of the LMP were to maintain a black crappie catch of 3.0/trap net, a northern pike catch of 3.0/gill net, and a bluegill catch of 5.0/trap net.   <br> 
 <br> 
A lake population assessment was conducted in July of 2013 to evaluate the status of the fish community.  This assessment consisted of 5 gill net sets and 9 trap net sets.   <br> 
 <br> 
Results <br> 
 <br> 
White sucker have been common in past assessments and were the most common fish present in the gill net catch in 2013.  The catch compared to similar lakes.  White sucker and shorthead redhorse appear to be important prey species in McQuade Lake.   <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike abundance appears to have increased in McQuade Lake over time.  Northern pike were generally sampled in low numbers prior to a 2000 assessment, but increased in the past two assessments.  The catch 2013 was typical compared to similar lakes but above average for McQuade Lake.  Size structure was moderate, as lengths ranged from 18.4 to 36.6 inches with an average of 22.5 inches.  Age and growth analysis identified 6 year classes (ages 1-6) and growth was relatively fast with pike exceeding 21 inches by age 4 and 26 inches by age 5.  Good angling opportunities appear to exist for pike, given the catch rate and size structure.  Anglers are encouraged to help maintain quality pike fishing by releasing pike over 24 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye were initially stocked in McQuade Lake in the 1980s in an effort to produce a self-sustaining population.  Walleye have occurred in low numbers since that time.  It should be noted that lakes with habitats similar to McQuade do not typically produce large walleye populations.  The catch in 2013 was typical for similar lakes and above average for McQuade Lake.  Captured walleye were generally large, ranging from 21.4 to 28.4 inches with an average length of 24.5 inches.  Captured walleye were older than age 8, indicating good adult survival, but poor recruitment in recent years.  McQuade Lake appears to provide a bonus fishery for large walleye. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch have declined over time and have been at or below the lake class first quartile value in the last three assessments.  The catch in 2013 was somewhat low compared to similar lakes and below average for McQuade.  Perch were generally too small to interest anglers, but are a valuable prey species for predators.  Low perch abundance is likely a limiting factor of walleye in McQuade Lake. <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie catches have varied over time, a typical trait for the species.  Inconsistent recruitment often results in variable year classes and boom and bust angling cycles.  The black crappie trap net catch failed to reach the LMP goal of 3.0/ trap net in 2013.  The trap net may be a poor indicator of crappie abundance in McQuade Lake during summer surveys, however.  The gill net catch was high compared to lakes with similar habitats, suggesting high abundance.  Size structure was moderate, as gill net caught crappie ranged from 4.5 to 11.7 inches with an average size of 7.8 inches.  Eight year classes were identified, but recruitment was inconsistent as 58% of the sample belonged to the 2010 year class.  Growth was somewhat slow, with individuals typically exceeding 8 inches by age 5. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegills have typically occurred in low numbers in McQuade Lake.  The catch in 2013 remained quite low, was below average for McQuade Lake, and failed to meet the 2002 LMP goal.  Trap net caught bluegill ranged from 3.2 to 8.5 inches with an average length of 6.4 inches.  Bluegill typically grow well in class 19 lakes, and growth from McQuade was near the lake class average, as bluegill typically exceeded 6 inches by age 5.  The popularity of the bluegill fishery is likely limited by low abundance.  <br> 
 <br> 
Exotic Chinese mystery snails exist in McQuade Lake.  Snails can form dense aggregations and disrupt native populations.  Snail die offs are often considered a nuisance by landowners as dead snails litter the lakeshore.  Anglers and boaters are reminded to help stop the spread of invasive species by removing all aquatic plants from boats, trailers, and equipment.  All drain plugs must be removed and live and bait wells must be drained before leaving the access.  Anglers and boaters are encouraged to power wash and thoroughly dry all equipment prior to use in another water body.    <br> 
 <br> 
Landowners should follow best management practices to help improve or at least maintain water quality.  These practices include allowing vegetated buffer strips along shorelines, maintaining shoreline and near shore vegetation, and avoiding the use of lawn fertilizers.   Additional best use practices can be found at www.dnr.state.mn.us. <br>

 Narrative = '<p>Mud is a 53 acre lake with 98% (52 acres) littoral area and a maximum depth of 20 feet. The lake is located just south of Twig, MN and has no public access.  Prior to this survey, Mud had never been surveyed by DNR Fisheries.  Mud was surveyed during the summer of 2011 to gather baseline information about fish populations and aquatic habitat.   <br> 
 <br> 
A total of 14 largemouth bass were sampled with electrofishing equipment.  The catch rate of largemouth bass was 10.1 fish per hour of electrofishing on-time.  Largemouth bass average length was 14.8 inches and growth was fast compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2002 through 2010 were represented in the sample, with a strong 2005 year-class.  <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike abundance was 3.0 per gillnet lift and was average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length was 22.6 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  A total of 17 northern pike were also captured in the trapnets, with fish up to 40.1 inches sampled.  All year-classes from 2003 to 2010 were represented except 2004. <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill abundance was 4.4 per trapnet lift and was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Average length of sampled bluegills was 6.0 inches and growth was average compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2005 to 2009 were represented.   <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie abundance was 0.8 per trapnet lift and was average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length was 7.5 inches but not enough individuals were  sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.  Recruitment appears sporadic, with only the 2005, 2006 and 2010 year-classes represented.   <br> 
 <br> 
One large 26.7 inch walleye was captured in the trapnets.  This fish likely emigrated from Pike Lake which is connected to Mud Lake by the Pine River. <br> 
 <br> 
Zero yellow perch were captured in the gillnets.  A total of five yellow perch were captured in trapnets.  Average length of perch was 6.2 inches but not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.  Perch from the 2006 and 2008 year-classes were represented.   <br> 
 <br> 
Other fish species sampled included black bullhead, Iowa darter, central mudminnow, creek chub, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish and white sucker.     <br> 
 <br> 
Information was collected on aquatic vegetation, substrate and water quality.  Twenty-one aquatic plant species or species groups were identified along 10 transects.  Coontail, bladderwort, star duckweed and white waterlily were the most frequently found plants (100% of transects) followed by narrow-leaf pondweed, northern milfoil and yellow water lily (90% of transects).  The most common substrate types were muck, detritus and sand which were identified along 100%, 80% and 40% of the transects, respectively.  Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Mud is a slightly acidic, moderately hard water lake with low fertility.	 <br> 
 <br> 
Oxygen concentrations too low to support most game fish species were observed in water depths greater than 4 feet.  Decomposition of abundant submerged vegetation, warm water temperatures, and minor contributions of atmospheric oxygen due to low lake fetch contributes to this condition. <br> 
 <br> 
Mud Lake was included in an index of biotic integrity (IBI) assessment in 2011.  In addition to standard gillnets and trapnets, beach seines and backpack electrofishing equipment were used to index species richness of the nearshore lake habitat.   <br>

Mud Hen Lake has a gravel, state-administered, back-in public access.  Currently, Mud Hen is stocked with walleye fry every even year and in any odd year following a winterkill.  Mud Hen was last assessed in 2008 and initially surveyed in 1992.  Mud Hen was surveyed during the summer of 2013 to update information about fish populations and to evaluate the success of the walleye fry stocking program. <br>

Walleye abundance of 7.8 per gillnet lift was up from 2008 (0.2) and was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 15.7 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  Three year-classes were present from 2008 through 2012.  The 2011 year-class was strong, contributing to 84% of the overall catch.  All walleye captured corresponded to stocked year-classes.   <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike abundance of 17.2 per gillnet lift was up from 2008 (10.2) and was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length was 21.2 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2007 through 2011 were represented, except 2008.  The 2010 year-class was strong, contributing to 63% of the overall catch. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch abundance of 35.5 per gillnet lift was up from 2008 (32.7) and was above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Numbers of yellow perch sampled have been increasing over the past four investigations on Mud Hen.  Average length of perch was 6.4 inches and growth was average when compared to other Duluth Area lakes.  All year-classes from 2007 to 2010 were represented.  The 2010 year-class was strong, contributing to 87% of the overall catch.  Quarter-inch trapnets sampled 9 young-of-the-year (YOY) yellow perch for a CPUE of 3.7 per lift. <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie abundance of 0.2 per trapnet lift was down from 2008 (2.3) and was below average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black crappie mean length was 9.9 inches but only 2 specimens were sampled.  Not enough individuals were sampled to evaluate stock density or growth.   <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill abundance of 2.8 per trapnet lift was up from 2008 (0.2) and average when compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Bluegill average length was 5.4 inches.  Bluegill were not aged for this assessment. <br> 
 <br> 
Three largemouth bass were sampled with electrofishing equipment.  The catch rate of largemouth bass was 4.5 per hour of electrofishing on-time.  No prior largemouth bass electrofishing assessments have been conducted on Mud Hen Lake.  One other 4.0 inch largemouth bass was captured in a trapnet.  Not enough individuals were captured to evaluate stock density or growth.  Largemouth bass have not been sampled in any previous surveys or assessments for Mud Hen.  Anecdotal reports from anglers indicate that a fishable population of largemouth bass is developing.   <br> 
 <br> 
Black bullhead abundance of 35.2 per trapnet lift was up from 2008 (0.4) and above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Black bullhead mean length was 6.2 inches.  Black bullhead quarter-inch trapnet abundance was 554.3 per lift. <br> 
 <br> 
Brown bullhead abundance of 0.0 per trapnet lift was down from 2008 (1.4) and below average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  However, four specimens were captured in the gillnets for an abundance of 0.7 per gillnet lift.  Brown bullhead mean length was 11.9 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow bullhead abundance of 0.6 per trapnet lift was down from 2008 (5.4) and above average compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Yellow bullhead mean length was 10.6 inches.  Yellow bullhead quarter-inch trapnet abundance was 9.0 per lift. <br> 
 <br> 
Other fish species sampled included pumpkinseed, golden shiner and white sucker. <br> 
 <br> 
Anecdotal evidence from lake residents suggests a partial winterkill event occurred during the winter of 2007-2008.  The fish community is consistent with a lake subject to winterkills with a high density of northern pike and black bullheads.  However, recent walleye stocking efforts have created a quality angling opportunity for this species. <br> 
 <br> 
Information was collected on aquatic vegetation, substrate and water quality.  Forty aquatic plant species or species groups were identified along 20 transects.  Filamentous algae was the most frequently found plant (95% of transects) followed by flat-stemmed pondweed and greater duckweed (both 85% of transects).  Beggertick, rush group, smartweed, spikerush, floating bur-reed and ribbon-leaved pondweed were the most infrequently found plants or plant groups (all found at 5% of transects).  The most common substrate types were detritus, muck and sand which were identified along 70%, 60% and 60% of the transects, respectively.  Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Mud Hen is an slightly alkaline, moderately hard water lake with moderate fertility.   <br> 
 <br> 
A substantial percentage (42%) of lakeshore homeowners on Mud Hen Lake have open yards extending to the shoreline.  Lakeshore owners can prevent excessive nutrient loading which leads to excessive plant growth and poor water quality by avoiding lawn fertilization, limiting aquatic vegetation removal, and implementing riparian best management practices.</p>'

Access to Net Lake is via a short portage trail, with trailhead at the southern tip of Junction Bay of Namakan Lake.  The Park does not maintain a boat or campsite on Net Lake. <br> 
 <br> 
As indicated by the 2006 investigation, the fish community of Net Lake consists of relatively few species.  The primary predator in the system is northern pike.  Pike abundance in 2006 (12.33/net) was high relative to other lakes in the same Classification and greatly exceeded abundance found in 1973 (6.34/net), the only previous fish survey of Net.  Most of the pike collected in the 2006 investigation were small.  Lengths ranged from 12.4 to 28.8 inches with an average of 19.9 inches.  Aging indicated that growth rates of pike are slow and that mortality rates were high. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch made up 28% of the total fish catch from Net Lake in 2006.  Yellow perch abundance (7.33/net) was typical of lakes in the same Classification.  The yellow perch abundance in 1973 was (27.17/net).  Most of the perch collected in 2006 were small (5 to 7 inches in length).  However, a few perch up to 12.5 inches were present.  Yellow perch growth in Net Lake was slow. <br>

Ole Lake ranks as eutrophic-to-mesotrophic, according to Carlson's Trophic State Index.Ole Lake was thermally stratified on 08/13/2001 with a surface temperature of 71 F and a bottom temperature of 50 F, and retained 2 ppm oxygen to a depth of 7 ft, where the temperature was 68 F.  Several small inlets drain local wetlands.  The outlet to Maxine Lake has beaver dams which limit fish movement.  Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline are mostly boulder, detritus, and ledgerock.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 7 ft; watershield, white waterlily, and plants associated with rocky shorelines are the most common plants.Ole Lake is entirely within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and is not on a designated route.  There are no campsites on the lake.Fish sampling in the 2001 fisheries lake survey consisted of two standard gillnet sets.  Trapnets were not used due to the difficult portage access, and shoreline seines were not used due to the difficult access and lack of suitable seining areas.The total catch of fish (all species combined) in the gillnets in 2001 of 21.0 fish/net (28.9 lb/net) was in the third quartile for this lake class.  Fish populations were dominated by white sucker.White sucker numbers in 2001 (13.0/gillnet) were in the fourth quartile for this lake class.

 Narrative = '<p>Oyster Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 7, which consists of 41 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are large, have very irregular shoreline shapes, and have very soft (infertile) water.  Oyster Lake is dissimilar to most Class 7 lakes in that it is smaller, deeper, and has a more uniform shoreline shape.  These differences are probably due to the unusual shape of Oyster Lake, which consists of one large, deep basin and one small, shallow basin.Oyster Lake stratifies thermally in midsummer, but retains good oxygen (more than 5 ppm) to the bottom.  The rocky shoreline drops off to deep water very quickly, and there is very little aquatic vegetation.The total catch of fish in 1996 (all species combined) was below normal for Lake Class 7, but was similar to previous assessment catches in this lake.  Lake Class 7 is one of the more productive lake classes in northeast Minnesota in terms of fish biomass, but as mentioned earlier, Oyster Lake is not typical of this lake class.Fish populations in 1996 were dominated by lake trout, white sucker, northern pike, and rock bass.Lake trout numbers in 1996 were higher than in previous assessments.  Most earlier assessments captured few lake trout, although assessment crews reported good angling.  Lake trout sizes averaged 14.4 in; the largest was 28.4 in (7.3 lb).Northern pike numbers in 1996 were near the average for this lake class, but were lower than in recent assessments.  Pike sizes averaged 22.7 in; the largest was 30.8 in.  Pike growth, 25 in at age four, was faster than average for the area.  Pike reproduction was fairly even from year-to-year.  Some of the pike were sent to the Environmental Protection Agency for a study on mercury accumulation in fish.Sucker numbers were normal for this lake class and were similar to previous assessments.  Rock bass numbers were higher than normal for this lake class, but were similar to previous assessments. Other fish species captured in low numbers in 1996 were cisco, burbot, and smallmouth bass.  Cisco sizes were small; the largest was 9.2 in.  Smallmouth numbers were low, but growth (11 in at age four) was faster than average for the area.  Smallmouth may be more abundant than indicated by this assessment as they are not easily caught in gillnets.     </p>'

There are 5 designated USFS campsites located around the lake for overnight camping. <br> 
 <br> 
Stuart is a softwater (low fertility) lake. The Stuart River flows through this lake with normal midsummer flows but may dry up in extremely dry summers. The inlet and outlet to Stuart Lake both have barriers to upstream fish movement (rapids and falls). Lake bottom substrates along the shoreline of Stuart Lake are mostly boulder and ledgerock, with small amounts of sand, rubble, and muck. Aquatic plants are sparse. <br>

Walleye, northern pike, yellow perch, cisco and white sucker were sampled during the lake survey in 2016. These species were sampled in numbers near or below average. Anecdotal reports indicate that  largemouth bass are also present in Stuart Lake.  <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye numbers in 2016 (4.4/gill net) were similar to the historic average for Stuart Lake and below average compared to other similar lakes in the area. The average walleye sampled was 13 inches and about 5 years old. The largest walleye sampled in 2016 was 26 inches long which was one of only 3 walleye over 15 inches sampled. Walleye fry are stocked into Stuart once every three years, but walleye are also naturally produced in non-stocked years. <br>

 Lake Clarity = '' 
 Narrative = '<p>Sunset Lake is in Ecological Lake Class 17, which consists of 99 lakes in northeast Minnesota that are small, shallow, have round lake basin shapes, and have water that is very soft, infertile, and turbid.  Sunset Lake differs from these lakes in that it is larger (305 acres) than the lake class average of 96 acres.  Sunset Lake does not stratify thermally in the summer and has good oxygen to the bottom.  Winter oxygen checks during 11 winters from 1970 through 1996 showed low oxygen (1-2 ppm) during three of these winters.  There are no inlets.  The outlet is navigable from Sunset Lake downstream 0.5 mi to a control dam built in 1973.  This dam prevents upstream fish movement.  The lake bottom along the shoreline is mostly mud (77 percent) and sand (17 percent).  Aquatic plants are sparse and are scattered along the shoreline to a depth of 2 ft.  The total catch of fish in the gillnets in 1996 (all species combined) of 26 fish/net (18 lb/net) was normal for this lake class.  Previous gillnet catches in 1983 and 1986 caught a similar total weight of fish, but numbers of fish were much higher due to higher numbers of small yellow perch.  The trapnet catch in 1996 was similar to previous trapnet catches in 1983 and 1988.Fish populations in 1996, as in 1983 and 1988, were dominated by northern pike, yellow perch, and black crappie.Northern pike numbers in 1996 were normal for this lake class and were similar to previous catches in this lake.  Pike sizes averaged 23 in in the gillnets, which is larger than normal for this lake class.  The largest pike in 1996 was 31 in (6.8 lb).  Pike reproduction was consistent from year to year.  Pike growth (20 in at age three) was normal.Yellow perch numbers in 1996, as in 1983 and 1988, were higher than normal for this lake class.  Perch sizes averaged 6 in; the largest was 10 in.  Many of the perch in 1996 were age three.  Growth of young perch (5 in at age three) was average, but growth of older perch (6 in at age six) was slow.Black crappie numbers in 1996, as in 1983 and 1986, were higher than normal for this lake class.  Many large crappie were present; the largest was 14 in (1.5 lb).  Most crappie were age two, and few crappie were produced during the cold summers of 1992 and 1993.  Growth of young crappie (3.7 in at age two) was normal, but growth of older crappie (10 in at age six) was fast.</p>'

Winter under-ice oxygen is good.  Aquatic plants are sparse and grow to a depth of 6 ft.  The inlet from Sletten Lake and the outlet to Grassy Lake are small and have barriers to upstream fish movement.The total catch of fish in 1997 (all species combined) of 10 fish/gillnet (1 lb/gillnet) was lower than normal for this lake class.  Fish production in this lake is limited by its small size, rocky bottom substrate, limited midsummer oxygen, and extremely low water fertility.Yellow perch were the only fish species captured in 1997.  Perch numbers (10/gillnet) were normal for this lake class and were similar to the previous perch catch of 8/gillnet in 1975.  Perch sizes in 1997 averaged 7"; the largest was 9".  Perch recruitment was distributed among four year classes.  Perch growth (5" at age five) was slower than normal for the area.Two 30" northern pike were captured in the 1975 gillnetting.

 Narrative = '<p>Upper Twin Pond is a small (1.7 acres), shallow (max. depth 9 feet) and fertile pond located within the city of Duluth along Skyline Drive.  Upper Twin Pond is a designated stream trout lake and has been managed for stream trout since 1932.  Although less than ideal trout habitat, the close proximity to Duluth and easy access to the pond have created a valuable put and take rainbow trout fishery.   <br> 
 <br> 
From 1941 until 1973 the pond received annual (except 1946, 1949 and 1972) plantings of rainbow, brown or brook trout yearlings.  Since 1991, approximately 400 rainbow trout have been stocked annually into Upper Twin Pond in the spring and early summer.  Upper Twin Pond was assessed during the fall of 2008 to evaluate the success of the stocking program and to document changes in the fish community.  Upper Twin Pond was last assessed in 1996, and prior to that in 1991.  <br> 
 <br> 
Rainbow trout abundance was 5.0 per gillnet lift.  This gillnet set was a special two hour timed set, in an effort to increase the sample size and ensure an adequate sample for contaminant analysis.   <br> 
 <br> 
Rainbow trout abundance of 1.8 per trapnet lift in Upper Twin Pond was up from 1996 (0.4) but down from 1991 (2.0).  Rainbow trout mean length of 10.6 inches was the same as in 1996 and 1991.  Rainbow trout ranged in size from 8.5 to 13.4 inches (9.2-12.1 in 1996).  The 2006 and 2007 year-classes were present in the sample.  Sixty percent of the rainbow trout captured were carry-over fish from the 2007 stocking (2006 year-class).  In 1996, no carry-over fish were captured.     <br> 
 <br> 
Three trapnets were also set into Lower Twin Pond after fish were seen surfacing and the crew identified that the barrier between the two ponds had been compromised.  The barrier was installed in the 1970s as a way to keep the two ponds separate, as Lower Twin Pond is managed as a swimming hole by the City of Duluth and is occasionally treated with chemicals.  Rainbow trout abundance was 3.0 per trapnet lift in these nets. <br> 
 <br> 
Black bullhead abundance of 8.6 per trapnet lift was up from 1996 (0.1) and 1991 (1.0).   Black bullhead mean length was 6.6 inches.   <br> 
 <br> 
White sucker abundance of 4.6 per trapnet lift was up from 1996 (3.8) but down from 1991 (12.3).  White sucker mean length was 8.1 inches.   <br>

Hartley Pond can be accessed by portaging 0.25 miles across a trail that originates at the parking lot of the Hartley Nature Center.  Shore fishing is possible from the face of the dam and from the northeast and southeast shores.  A full survey (trapnets only) was conducted during the summer and fall of 2009 to update information aquatic habitat and fish populations. <br> 
 <br> 
Yearling brown trout were stocked in most years from 1989 through 2008.  Beginning in 2009 brown trout were stocked into Tischer Creek below Hartley Pond, instead of in the pond.  Stocking location was changed due to high summer water tempertures.  No brown trout were captured during the 2009 lake survey. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch catch rates for standard and double-pot (special) trapnets of 1.0 and 6.5 per lift was similar to the 2004 investigation (2.0-1.7).  The catch rate for standard trapnets was considered typical compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Mean length of yellow perch sampled in standard trapnets was 6.4 inches.  Length at age-2 of 5.8 inches represented fast growth compared to other Duluth Area populations.  Age analysis revealed four year-classes represented from 2002 through 2008, with a strong 2007 year-class. <br> 
 <br> 
Only two largemouth bass were sampled during the 2004 investigation.  Largemouth bass standard and special trapnet catch rates were 0.3 and 2.0 in 2009 and a total of eight bass were sampled from all gear types.  Mean length of bass sampled by special trapnet was 7.2 inches.  Age analysis revealed no bass older than age-2 and all but one were recruited from the 2007 year-class. <br> 
 <br> 
Pumpkinseed sunfish standard trapnet catch rate of 7.3 per lift had declined since 2004 (12.2) but special trapnet catch rate of 37.5 per lift had increased (8.0).  Pumpkinseed mean length was 4.2 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Black bullhead standard and special trapnet catch rates of 1.0 and 11.5 per lift had declined since 2004 (7.5 and 48.7).  Mean length of bullhead sampled by special trapnet of 8.0 inches had increased since 2004 (5.0). <br> 
 <br> 
White sucker standard trapnet catch rate of 7.3 per lift had declined since 2004 (13.0) and had fallen to within what was considered typical compared to other Minnesota lakes of similar type.  Conversely, special trapnet catch rate had increased from 28.7 per lift in 2004 to 47.0 in 2009.  White sucker mean length from standard trrapnets of 12.8 inches had increased since 2004 (8.7). <br> 
 <br> 
Other fish species sampled include bluegill and golden shiner.  Bluegill were not sampled during the 2004 investigation. <br> 
 <br> 
Information was collected on aquatic vegetation, substrate and water quality.  Diversity of aquatic plants was low with 20 species or species groups identified along 10 transects.  However, density was high, with water marigold identified as abundant at 100% of the transects and cattail, coontail, floating-leaf pondweed and lesser duckweed identified at 90% of the transects.  Five other plant species were identified at greater than 60% of the transects.  Muck, which was identified at 100% of the transects, was the most abundant substrate type.  All other substrate types were rated as rare with percent occurrence of 20 or less.  Results of laboratory water analysis indicate Hartley Pond is a slightly alkaline (pH 7.8), moderately hard water lake (alkalinity 107 ppm) with moderate fertility (total phosphorus 0.028 ppm). <br>

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/08/2015 Clarity: 7' 
 Narrative = '<p>A standard survey was conducted during late June of 2015 in Monson Lake. Monson is a small sized (208 acres), shallow (21 feet maximum depth), and moderately productive lake located in Swift County. Monson Lake State Park is located along the east side of the lake. Residential development is limited to 5 homes and 2 recreational vehicles along the south, north and west shore areas. The public access and shore fishing pier are located on the east side in the state park. A park sticker is required if driving a motor vehicle on to the access site. Usage of Monson State Park and the corresponding public access is generally low compared to nearby Sibley State Park on Lake Andrew. The surrounding watershed is comprised of mostly agricultural row crops with small areas of woodland, grassland, pasture, and wetland areas. The immediate shoreline area consists mostly of undeveloped woodland (hardwood trees) with small to moderate areas of wetlands, row crops, and grassland. Agricultural row crop runoff (via inlets) is the primary source of nutrient inputs into Monson. Nutrient levels were high in Monson during 2015. There are three small sized inlets (northwest, northeast, and south shores) that flow into Monson. The Monson outlet connects to West Sunburg Lake, which is a shallow, productive and sometimes susceptible winterkill lake. Fish movement is possible between West Sunburg and Monson during high water levels, which has resulted in excellent growth and fishing for large sized sunfish following periods of mild winters. Water levels were below normal during the early spring and fall, but normal during the summer of 2015. Water clarity (secchi reading) was good (7.0 feet) during early June, but poor (2.1 feet) by early August of 2015. Blue-green algae blooms can be common during the mid to late summer months in Monson Lake. Submergent vegetation is dense and diverse with northern milfoil, various pondweed species (flat-stem, curly-leaf, clasping-leaf, leafy, sago pondweed), coontail, water moss, and filamentous algae present in Monson. Emergent vegetation is also abundant and diverse consisting of various bulrush species, cattail species, duckweed species, burreed, arrowhead, and reed canary grass scattered throughout the bay, shoreline, and island areas. Shoalwater substrates are varied with sand, silt, boulder, gravel, rubble, muck and clay. Monson can be a popular winter fishery when the Walleye or panfish angler catch is good. There are also good Northern Pike spearing prospects during the winter. Largemouth Bass fishing opportunities for large fish are often excellent during the early summer months.  <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike numbers were abundant in 2015 (11.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range and Monson historical average (5.14 fish/gillnet). The Northern Pike average size was small (2.52 pounds and 22.0 inches) from gillnets. There were low numbers of Northern Pike greater than 28.0 inches in the survey catch.  <br> 
 <br> 
Black Crappie numbers were low in 2015 (0.33 fish/trapnet). The Black Crappie average size was small (0.04 pounds and 4.2 inches) from trapnets.  <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow Perch numbers were abundant (21.50 fish/gillnet), but the average size was small (0.09 pounds, 5.8 inches) in 2015. The Yellow Perch historical average catch rate is 11.79 fish/gillnet for Monson Lake.  <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill numbers were abundant in 2015 (70.78 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range and Monson historical average (18.45 fish/trapnet). The Bluegill average size was small (0.11 pounds and 5.1 inches) from trapnets. Most of the Bluegill captured from the survey nets were from the 2012 year class. The Bluegill historical average weight is 0.26 pounds from trapnets. There were abundant numbers of large Bluegill captured in the previous 2010 survey (2.67 fish/trapnet 10.0 inches or larger), however no fish over 8.0 inches were captured in the 2015 survey. The largest Bluegill captured was 11.8 inches (about 2 pounds) in the 2010 survey, but only 7.3 inches in the 2015 survey. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye numbers were moderately abundant in 2015 (6.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal range and Monson historical average (4.48 fish/gillnet). The 2015 Walleye average size was moderate (1.10 pounds and 14.0 inches) from gillnets. Large sized Walleye (5.39 pounds average) were caught in the 2015 trapnets (1.22 fish/trapnet). Walleye growth rates are excellent in Monson. Walleye natural reproduction in Monson is generally infrequent and insignificant based on previous fall and summer surveys. Various combinations of Walleye fingerlings, yearlings and adults (200-450 pounds per stocking year) have been stocked in recent years. Walleye were last stocked into Monson during 2014 (100 fingerlings, 10 pounds; 1,472 yearlings, 339 pounds; 219 adults, 94 pounds).  <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth Bass numbers overall were low (17.29 fish/hour) in the 2015 spring electrofishing survey. However, there were abundant numbers (16.27 fish/hour) of Largemouth Bass 15.0 inches and larger captured in the spring electrofishing survey. The 2015 Largemouth Bass average size was large (3.07 pounds and 17.33 inches) from spring electrofishing. Largemouth Bass growth rates are excellent in Monson. <br> 
 <br> 
Black Bullhead numbers were low in 2015 (0.56 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range and Monson historical average (23.86 fish/trapnet). The Black Bullhead average size was large (1.61 pounds and 14.06 inches) from trapnets. <br> 
 <br> 
Current fish management activities on Monson include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Monson fishery will be sampled in the 2019 summer for all fish species. <br>

 Narrative = '<p>     Big Swan Lake is a popular fishing lake west of the Town of Burtrum in Todd County.   The lake supports dense submerged vegetation as well as bulrush beds and a cattail fringe around the north basin and west shore of the south basin.  Big Swan Lake lies within an agricultural watershed, which after snow melt and rain events has been known to negatively affect water clarity in the lake.  The lake also has curly leaf pondweed, which adds to the mid-summer nutrient load.  Algae blooms during the summer are a common occurrence.  Coontail and flatstem pondweed were the most common submergent species found during the 2008 survey and sand the most common shallow water substrate.   Mats of filamentous algae and star duckweed were also common along shore.   <br> 
     The lake supports a diverse fish community that attracts anglers, including species such as walleye, northern pike, largemouth bass, bluegill, and black crappie.   There is a regulation on the lake prohibiting the possession of northern pike between 24 and 36 inches, with one over 36 inches allowed.  The goal of the regulation is to improve the size structure of the pike population while decreasing numbers.  Northern pike abundance, however, did show an increase since the last survey and appears to be at a record high.  Most of the pike observed in the survey were between 20 and 23 inches in length, however, fish over 36 inches are present.   <br> 
     Walleye stocking appears to sustain the fishery in Big Swan Lake and a wide range of sizes look to be available to anglers.  Average size in the survey was about 2 pounds but some trophy size fish have been observed.  Trophy size largemouth bass over 19 inches in length have also been observed in assessments, but the average size most anglers will catch is between 11 to 13 inches.  Yellow perch abundance appears to have increased since the last survey and although some anglers consider them to be pests, they can be an important food species for both northern pike and walleye.  Perch can also be instrumental in helping maintain a well-balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality individuals.   <br> 
      Bluegill provide a popular summer fishery in the area at times.  Anglers report having good luck catching 6 to 7-inch bluegill and fish up to 10 inches have been found.  Winter seems to be the best time to find black crappies in Big Swan Lake.  Recent reports indicate the presence of a strong year class providing 8 to 10-inch crappie during the day thru the ice.  Both ice-out assessments and summer surveys have documented larger crappie over 12 inches.  Other panfish species in Big Swan Lake include pumpkinseed sunfish, rock bass, and hybrid sunfish. <br> 
     Big Swan Lake would also be an excellent choice for any angler seeking quality size bullhead.  All three species of bullhead are present in the lake and both the brown and yellow bullhead catches had individuals over 13 inches in length.  Bowfin or dogfish, common carp, and white sucker were also caught during the survey.  Carp numbers appear to be low at this time, while abundance of bowfin and white sucker was within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes. <br> 
     Along with the release of the larger northern pike, anglers are encouraged to catch and release the larger individuals of other species to achieve a balanced fish community and provide opportunity for trophy fish.  Improving the water quality in Big Swan Lake should be a high priority of the lake association and landowners around the lake.  Preservation of the emergent vegetation beds can help to improve water quality and protect shorelines as well as valuable fish habitat.  Buffer strips along inlets and lakeshore property would also help to reduce nutrients entering the lake.  Maintaining adequate septic systems, keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out of the lake, and the use of zero phosphorus lawn fertilizer are all ways for homeowners to help reduce added nutrients from entering the lake and contributing to excess algae and weed growth.   The Todd County Planning and Zoning Office in Long Prairie has a website which provides information for shoreland property owners. <br>

 Survey Date = '2009-08-24',  County Name = 'Todd', Lake Name = 'Guernsey' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/24/2009 Clarity: 2.9' 
 Narrative = '<p>       Guernsey Lake is a fertile, riverine lake.  As part of the Sauk River, the lake is strongly influenced by the predominantly agricultural land use practices in the watershed.  Severe algae blooms are common in summer, which negatively affects water clarity and vegetation growth.  The secchi disk reading at the time of the summer survey was 2.9 feet.  Cattail was the most common plant species found in the lake and formed a fringe around most of the basin.  Very little in-lake vegetation was found, likely due to the poor water clarity.  Low water levels can, at times, hinder boat accessiblity.   Some shoreline fishing occurs along the mouth of the Sauk River at the boat access.  A spring assessment was also conducted in early June of 2009 to evaluate the bluegill and black crappie populations. <br> 
       There are several fish species in Guernsey Lake that may attract anglers.  While bluegill are probably the most popular species, there is an abundant northern pike population that could provide some excellent fishing.   There was a wide range of sizes observed in the pike catches in both the summer survey and spring assessment.  Average size of the pike in the summer survey at 24 inches or 3.6 pounds was better than most lakes in the area.  Anglers also have a chance to see trophy size fish over 40 inches in length.   The walleye population is sustained through natural reproduction so abundance may vary from year to year and anglers may have to work to find them.  The largemouth bass population appears to be low according to spring electrofishing results, but all the bass caught were over 12 inches.  A smallmouth bass was sampled for the first time by DNR gear in the spring assessment.  Yellow perch numbers appear to be low which may be a result of the high northern pike numbers.  Perch can be a principal prey species for both pike and walleye.  An abundant white sucker population may, however, provide an alternative food source for the gamefish. <br> 
        Bluegill abundance may be down but some quality size fish are still present as most of the bluegill in the spring assessment were over 7 inches in length.  Black crappie is one fish species that has adapted to turbid water.  The species is probably the most abundant fish in Guernsey Lake as they were the most numerous species in both the spring and summer nets.  Crappie reproduction has been excellent in 4 of the last 5 years and small fish as well as eating size are plentiful.  There were, however, some crappie over 10 inches observed in the spring assessment.  	 <br> 
       Carp are another species that has adapted well to turbid water and they appear to be very abundant in Guernsey Lake.    Carp were caught in both the spring and summer nets and were also quite numerous in the electrofishing effort.  Two species of bullhead, brown and yellow, were present in the lake although they are likely not abundant.  Other species in the fish community include bowfin or dogfish, hybrid sunfish, and pumpkinseed.   <br> 
       Anglers and spearers are encouraged to release the larger northern pike and walleye to minimize impacts on the fish community.  Voluntarily limiting harvest of the large panfish will help sustain the quality and balance of the populations.   A study of the water quality issues in Guernsey Lake has been initiated by the Sauk River Watershed District and MPCA.  <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2013-08-19',  County Name = 'Todd', Lake Name = 'Latimer' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/19/2013 Clarity: 2.8' 
 Narrative = '<p>         Latimer Lake is a eutrophic or fertile lake in Todd County whose fish community is dominated by Northern Pike, small Black Crappies, and Black Bullheads. Water clarity has been an issue for the lake with heavy algae blooms being common by mid-July and lasting until fall. The lake does support gamefish which provide angling opportunities, species such as Largemouth Bass, Northern Pike, and Walleye as well as Bluegills.  <br> 
        The lake is managed primarily for Northern Pike and Walleye with Black Crappie and Bluegills being secondary management species. Walleye fingerlings typically are stocked in odd-numbered years and while numbers appear to be within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes, the catch rate was below the management goal. With the poor water clarity through the summer, night fishing for Walleye is probably not necessary. Anglers who do hook into a Walleye are likely to catch a nice one as the average size caught in the summer survey was about 3 pounds. Northern Pike numbers have increased since the last survey which may have a negative impact on the recruitment of the Walleye fingerlings to the adult population.  Despite the higher numbers, some nice sized pike were observed in the survey up to 33 inches.  Average size for the pike in the survey was 22 inches or 2.5 pounds although the fish did show slow growth rates.  Anglers should continue to harvest small Northern Pike which are more abundant and release those over 24 inches in length to help the fish community balance.  <br> 
        Yellow Perch numbers are within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes but higher numbers could benefit both the Northern Pike and Walleye.  Perch can be an important prey species for the two predator species plus higher numbers could help reduce pike predation on Walleye fingerlings.   Black Crappie can become abundant in turbid lakes and this is the case in Latimer. Numbers are well above those found in lakes of similar type and small fish dominate the population. Few of the crappie caught in the summer survey were over 9 inches in length due primarily to poor growth rates. A reduction in abundance through fishing or natural means will be required to improve the size structure of the crappie population.  Bluegill numbers were also high but the size structure of the population may be more appealing to anglers. Average size of the fish caught was about 6 inches with few over 7 inches in length.  Pumpkinseed and hybrid sunfish are also present but most of them were under 6 inches in length. Largemouth Bass are present in low numbers and provide limited opportunity for anglers but some large fish are present. <br> 
        The Black Bullhead population has been historically high acting as an indicator of the poor water quality as they are more abundant in lakes with turbid water.  Although the average size was under 9 inches some Black Bullhead up to 12 inches were observed.   Some Brown Bullhead were also caught but were much lower in abundance than the Black Bullhead. Some of the Brown Bullhead did reach lengths of almost 13 inches. Neascus or black spot was common on Yellow Perch and Northern Pike, as well as a few Walleye caught in the survey. Neascus is a trematode or parasite that is usually found in the skin of the fish. The life cycle of the parasite also includes snails and fish-eating birds, such as herons and bitterns. Filleting the fish removes most of the parasites and cooking will kill the rest. Humans cannot be infested by neascus.  Some of the Yellow Perch also were infested with yellow grub. <br> 
      Water quality problems in Latimer Lake likely result from a combination of factors which include an agricultural watershed, heavy development along the west shore, and in-lake nutrients. Shoreline buffers along the inlets and the lakeshore would help to filter some of the incoming nutrients from the watershed and lawns. <br>

 Survey Date = '2015-05-27',  County Name = 'Todd', Lake Name = 'Little Sauk' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/17/2015 Clarity: 3.8' 
 Narrative = '<p>Little Sauk is a medium size (268 acre) lake with a maximum depth of 29 feet.  It is a riverine lake with the Sauk River entering and exiting the lake on opposite ends.  A spring panfish assessment was conducted on Little Sauk Lake near the end of May, 2015.  Panfish assessments are conducted more frequently on Little Sauk Lake due to conservation limits and amount of fishing pressure for panfish on the lake.  The Sauk River watershed is dominated by agricultural land uses and Little Sauk Lake's water quality reflects watershed conditions.  Water quality is poor resulting in a hypereutrophic classification.  Summer clarity is generally in the 2-4 foot range.  Movement of fish in and out of the lake via the Sauk River can be significant, especially during severe winters when oxygen levels drop.  Substantial habitat changes have occurred in the lake over the last decade.  Submerged vegetation beds which once covered much of the lake are now much less prominent.  "Conservation" fishing regulations have been in place since 2000 when a public access was developed.  Bag limits were reduced for several species including:  Bluegill-5, Black Crappie-5, Walleye-2, Largemouth Bass-1, Yellow Perch-10. <br> 
     Black Crappie are abundant and the species most targeted by anglers year-round.  Crappie appear to be benefitting from the reduction in vegetation as record numbers were observed in spring trap nets in 2015.  Large numbers of crappie in the 9-11 inch range are present with a few exceeding 12 inches. Crappie over nine inches accounted for 75% (n=515) of the catch with 32% (n=217) more than ten inches and 0.7% (n=5) over twelve inches in length.   In contrast, Bluegill have not benefitted from the loss of vegetated habitats.  Low numbers were observed in spring trap nets but the size structure was good.  Nearly 50% of the Bluegills were 8 inches or longer and a few over 9 inches were measured.  Bluegill abundance was much higher when there was more vegetation.  Growth rates of both Black Crappie and Bluegill are favorable.   <br> 
       An increase in the distribution and density of aquatic plants would improve conditions for desirable fish species such as Bluegill, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass.    Proper land use practices in the watershed and along the shoreline are encouraged to improve the lake's water quality and facilitate aquatic plant growth.  Minimizing vegetation removal along the lakeshore will help protect the shoreline from erosion, provide fish and wildlife habitat, and reduce nutrients entering the water. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2015-05-27',  County Name = 'Todd', Lake Name = 'Maple' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/22/2015 Clarity: 8' 
 Narrative = '<p>Maple Lake is a fertile, moderately sized lake with a maximum depth of 23 feet.  The lake can be fairly turbid during the summer months with heavy growth of submerged vegetation.  Most recreation on the lake occurs in the form of fishing which can draw numbers of people year-round. <br> 
 A spring panfish trap net assessment was conducted on Maple Lake in late-May of 2015 which targeted Bluegill and Black Crappie.  Panfish provide an important fishery in the area and the assessment was used to gather information on the size structure of the populations.  A special sunfish regulation is being implemented March 1st, 2016 for Maple Lake that would reduce the bag limit to ten sunfish.  Maple Lake has a reputation of producing seven to nine inch Bluegill and receives heavy fishing pressure from anglers targeting the species.  It is hoped that a reduction in harvest will allow more fish to attain greater age and size.   Considerable numbers of both Bluegill and Black Crappie reside in Maple Lake.  Bluegills are abundant and grow fast but the numbers of large fish appear to be limited by fishing pressure.  The 2015 spring panfish trap net assessment sampled 537 Bluegill between 4 and 8.9 inches in length.  Seven inch sunfish are common but few reach 9 inches.    Crappie are also quite numerous.  Fish in the 2015 spring panfish trap net assessment measured from 6.4 to 11.6 inches in length with a mean length of 7.8 inches.    Smaller crappie dominated the 2015 sample as the majority of fish (60%; n=338) were between seven and eight inches in length.   Crappie reproduction was very strong in 2011 producing a huge year class which dominated the trap net assessment in 2015. <br> 
      Maple Lake is located in an area dominated by agricultural land uses which combined with its shallow basin results in a very fertile (eutrophic) state.  Proper land use practices in the watershed and along the shoreline are encouraged to improve the lake's water quality.  Minimizing vegetation removal along the lakeshore will help protect the shoreline from erosion, provide fish and wildlife habitat, and reduce nutrients entering the water. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2012-07-23',  County Name = 'Todd', Lake Name = 'Moose' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/23/2012 Clarity: 3' 
 Narrative = '<p>     Moose Lake is a popular panfish lake north of Burtrum along Highway 28.  Bluegill and black crappie provide fishing opportunity year round while spring time seems to be the most popular time for walleye fishing.   The lake does not have much for fishing structures other than a sunken island, fallen trees, and edges of waterlily beds.  Water quality has been an ongoing problem in the lake with algae blooms common in the summer months.   Filamentous algae and star duckweed were the two most frequently encounted aquatic plants which is common with nutrient rich water.   Coontail, flatstem pondweed, and fries' pondweed were the most common submergent plants and grew to a depth of 9 feet.  Sand was the most prevalent shallow water substrate.  Moose Lake falls in the category of a eutrophic lake characterized by limited transparency, frequent algae blooms, high in nutrient concentrations, and oxygen depletions below the thermocline.  At the time the survey was conducted in late July, little oxygen was available to fish below the 9 foot depth. <br> 
     The primary management species for Moose Lake is largemouth bass.  A regulation limiting the size of bass in possession to 12 inches or under is in effect on the lake.  The goal of the regulation is to increase the number of bass over 17 inches while allowing the harvest of fish under 12 inches which are more numerous.  The lake has an abundant bass population with a wide range of sizes available to anglers including fish up to 19 inches.   <br> 
   A spring panfish trap net assessment was done in May of 2012 to evaluate the adult bluegill and black crappie populations.   Moose Lake supports an abundant crappie population that is dominated by smaller fish as average length was 7.3 inches in the 2012 assessments.  Although most of the crappie were less than 9 inches in length a few fish up to 11 inches were observed.  The bluegill population is also dominated by smaller fish, but, the lake is known for producing fish up to 10 inches.  Fast growth has helped to sustain some quality in the past; however, present population appears much reduced in terms of quality.   <br> 
    Northern pike numbers appear to be low when compared to similar type lakes.   Average size was better than in most lakes in the area at 3.4 pounds and anglers also have the opportunity to encounter quality size fish as a pike over 36 inches was caught in the spring panfish assessment.  Despite a low perch population, pike growth was good.  Lower pike numbers may allow the yellow perch population to rebound in abundance.  Higher perch numbers are desirable to help maintain good growth rates in both northern pike and walleye.  Perch can also be instrumental in helping maintain a well-balanced bluegill population with fast growing, quality sized individuals. <br> 
     The walleye fishery in the lake is maintained by stocking.  While fall fingerling stocking had been the primary method, Moose Lake was part of a Research study that was conducted to determine if frylings would be a viable option.  Frylings are typically stocked in June and are less costly to produce although they are much smaller than fingerlings and more susceptible to predation.   Anglers have an opportunity to catch a nice size walleye as most of the fish seen in the 2012 assessments were between 16 and 27 inches.   <br> 
    Two species of bullhead, black and yellow, were caught in the 2012 assessments.  Yellow bullhead were the more numerous, and quality size individuals up to 14 inches were caught in both species.   Other members of the fish community include pumpkinseed sunfish, bowfin or dogfish, and common carp.   <br> 
     Releasing larger northern pike and walleye is encouraged along with voluntary release of large bluegill and black crappie to achieve a more balanced fish community.  Water quality in Moose Lake is a major concern.  Although much of the immediate shoreline is still covered in forest, the watershed is dominated by cultivated row crops.   Surrounding land use practices can be having a detrimental effect on water quality and the recreational value of the lake.  Some effort may be needed to identify sources of excess phosphorus so plans can be developed to reduce these sources.  Buffer strips along inlets and lakeshore property are encouraged to reduce nutrients entering the lake.  Maintaining adequate septic systems, keeping grass clippings and raked leaves out of the lake, and the use of zero phosphorus lawn fertilizer are all ways landowners can reduce nutrients entering the lake, thus slowing algae and excess weed growth. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2014-08-11',  County Name = 'Todd', Lake Name = 'Osakis' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/13/2014 Clarity: 3.5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Lake Osakis (6,270 acres) is a nutrient-rich, highly productive basin located in Douglas and Todd counties.  Due to high nutrient levels, water quality can be seasonally impaired with periodic algal blooms and low water clarity (< 3.5 feet).  In addition, shorelines of Lake Osakis have been heavily developed, resulting in the disturbance of sensitive aquatic habitats.  Landowners and recreational users are encouraged to minimize disturbance to remaining aquatic habitats.  Such areas provide necessary habitat for fishes and other wildlife.  Currently, Lake Osakis is not infested with zebra mussels or Eurasian watermilfoil (common aquatic invasive species).  Anglers are reminded to drain boats and equipment prior to moving them between bodies of water and to adhere to other aquatic invasive species laws in an effort to keep invasive species out of Lake Osakis. <br> 
   <br> 
Lake Osakis supports a diverse fish community including both sport and non-game fishes.  Walleye catch rates (14.2 fish/gill net) have increased relative to past surveys and are above average compared to similar lakes in Minnesota.  Thirty-six percent of Walleyes captured during the 2014 survey exceeded 15.0 inches.  Fourteen percent were greater than 20.0 inches in length.  Average size of Walleyes was 15.6 inches and 1.4 pounds.  Anglers are reminded of a 15.0-inch minimum size limit for Walleye in Lake Osakis.  The regulation is intended to improve quality of the Walleye fishery. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern Pike proved moderately abundant (4.5 fish/gill net).  Size of gill net captures ranged from 14.6 to 31.9 inches and averaged 22.2 inches.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest surplus stocks of small- and moderate-sized Northern Pike (i.e., < 26.0 inches) in an effort to reduce competition and improve the fishery. <br> 
  <br> 
Lake Osakis supports quality bass and panfish fishing opportunities.  Black Crappie catches during the 2014 survey averaged 12.0 fish/trap net.  This catch rate described a very abundant population.  The Black Crappie population supported a high-quality fishery.  Approximately 40% of all fish surveyed exceeded 10.0 inches in length.  Bluegill densities were modest in relative comparison to many other lakes in west-central Minnesota, but due to a fairly low density and fast growth, Lake Osakis has a history of producing large Bluegills.  No one-pound Bluegill captures were recorded in the 2014 catch, but approximately 14% of Bluegill captures exceeded 8.0 inches.  The lake supports both Largemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass populations.  A spring electrofishing catch rate of 40.0 Largemouth Bass/hour describes relatively modest bass density.   Average size captured was 14.2 inches.  The largest measured was 18.2 inches in total length.  Smallmouth bass are less abundant and provide bonus fishing experiences.  Few Yellow Perch captures during the 2014 survey were large enough to stimulate targeted harvest. <br> 
 <br> 
Other notable fishes present in Lake Osakis include Tullibee (Cisco), Bowfin (Dogfish), and three species of Bullhead (Brown, Yellow, Black).  Lake Osakis has produced state record fish including Yellow Bullhead (3 lbs. 10oz.) and Rock Bass (2 lbs. 0 oz.).   <br> 
 <br> 
Due to the popularity of Osakis' fisheries resources, recreational activity can be high in both open water and winter seasons.  Heavy, size-specific harvest influences the size and abundance of popular sport fish populations.  Anglers are encouraged to harvest the smaller, more abundant fishes.  For example, harvesting small Northern Pike would likely increase growth of remaining Northern Pike and provide benefits to other fish species (e.g., Walleye). <br> 
 <br> 
Three public accesses are available.  Battle Point Access (located in the northeast corner of the main lake basin along the north shoreline of Battle Point) includes a boat launch, fishing pier, walking trails, shore fishing sites, and a fish cleaning station.  An additional public access is located in the town of Osakis along the south shoreline.  This access has two launch ramps, a fishing pier, and area for picnics.  The final public access is located on the western side of Lake Osakis.  Care should be taken when launching large boats on any of Lake Osakis' accesses, as they can be shallow and hazardous during low water periods.  Additionally, caution should be taken when navigating near Moon Bar (southwest of Battle Point) to avoid large rocks (some are marked with hazard buoys).  <br>

 Survey Date = '2015-08-24',  County Name = 'Todd', Lake Name = 'Sauk' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 08/25/2015 Clarity: 6' 
 Narrative = '<p>Big Sauk is a large, riverine lake with a maximum depth of 59 feet.  The lake encompasses 2,094 acres  with the Sauk River entering and exiting the lake on opposite ends.  The Sauk River watershed is dominated by agricultural land uses and Big Sauk Lake's water quality reflects watershed conditions.  Water quality is poor resulting in a very eutrophic state.  Nutrient levels are much higher than most lakes in central Minnesota.  Summer clarity is generally in the 3-5 foot range and may limit recreational use.  Substantial habitat changes have occurred in the lake over the last decade.  Submerged vegetation beds which once covered much of the lake are now much less prominent.  Walleye and Bluegill are the two primary management species.  The lake was once noted for its productive Bluegill fishery which has diminished with the loss of vegetated habitats.   Walleye have drawn increased attention from anglers but overall fishing pressure appears to be down.  <br> 
     Walleye showed up in record numbers in the 2015 gill nets.  Annual fry stocking has produced consistent year classes resulting in a range of sizes available to anglers.  Fish from 8 to 28 inches were observed in the 2015 netting with a high percentage in the 15-20 inch range.  This improved population has provided good fishing during winter and the open water season.  Northern Pike numbers have dropped since the lakes vegetation beds declined.  Pike numbers remain near their low point, however the majority exceeded 20 inches in the gill nets.  Fish over 30 inches are present and a fair number of small pike (9-18 inches) were captured in spring trap nets providing hope for a rebound. <br> 
     Black Crappie have been abundant throughout the lake's history and they remain numerous.  Reproduction is consistent with all sizes well represented up to 11 inches.  Average size is usually about 8-9 inches.  Few crappie seem to exceed 11 inches, probably due to relatively high natural and angling mortality.  Bluegill numbers have remained well below historical levels since the reduction in vegetation.  An improvement in Bluegill abundance cannot be expected to occur unless there is an increase in available habitat.  Bluegill size structure is excellent as average size is over 7 inches and 9-10 inch fish are regularly observed.  Growth rates are fast.  Largemouth Bass numbers also appear to have dropped in response to the vegetation decline.  As with the Bluegill, large bass comprise much of the population with an average size over 14.5 inches and many in the 16-19 inch range.  Big Sauk has a history of producing trophy size bass as several fish over 7 pounds have been documented during past tournaments.  Smallmouth Bass have just recently been discovered in the lake with an adult captured during electrofishing and several young-of-year documented during nearshore seining. <br> 
     Big Sauk Lake supports an abundant and diverse prey base resulting in fast growth by predator species such as Walleye, Northern Pike, and Largemouth Bass.  Yellow Perch are a primary prey fish and are highly abundant, especially in the 5-8 inch range.  White Sucker are also numerous in a variety of sizes from 6 to 20 inches.  Spottail Shiners and Bluntnose Minnows were captured in substantial numbers in near shore seining.  Common Shiners, Golden Shiners and Fathead Minnows were also observed in the seines. <br> 
     Northern Cisco (Tullibee) continue to maintain a viable population in the lake despite poor water quality.  Cisco are sensitive to warming and degradation of water quality so their presence is a positive indicator of lake health.  Some large cisco were sampled with three fish in excess of 18 inches.  Several cisco in the 10-11 inch range were also netted indicating continued recruitment.   Other sensitive species  present in Big Sauk Lake include:  Iowa Darter, Logperch, Tadpole Madtom, Blacknose Shiner, Banded Killifish, and Smallmouth Bass.  These species are considered intolerant to pollution and habitat degradation.  The loss of any of these indicator species would suggest a decline in water quality and/or habitat suitability. <br> 
     Common Carp are abundant in Big Sauk Lake and commercial harvest has been practiced.  Carp have been present in DNR sampling since about 1990.  Carp continue to recruit regularly to the population as evidenced by the variety of sizes observed during sampling.  Gill nets in 2015 caught numbers of carp in the 11-16 inch range and several more between 21 and 30 inches.  Spring trap nets in 2015 captured some 8-10 inch carp and many in the 18-31 inch range, while nearshore seines produced young-of-year carp.   Carp may be at least partially responsible for the reduction of vegetative growth within the lake.  Other rough fish species living in Big Sauk include Black, and Brown Bullheads and Bowfin (Dogfish) with all being present in low to moderate abundance.   <br>

Sand and gravel along with detritus were the most common shallow water substrates.  <br> 
        The lake supports a fish community that is typical of lakes which experience periodic winterkills although none have occurred recently. Black Bullhead, Brown Bullhead, and Northern Pike were the most common fish species found in the survey. The lake has an abundance of Northern Pike which can have a negative impact on the fish community. Despite their abundance, some nice fish were seen in the survey with the average size about 2.5 pounds and some over six pounds sampled. Walleye fry stocking appears to sustain the Walleye fishery in the lake although there has been evidence of some natural reproduction.   While the survey catch did not meet management goals for the lake, periodically anglers report good Walleye fishing usually early in the season.  Thunder supports a moderate number of Largemouth Bass available in a wide range of sizes.  Most of the bass were between 9 and 11 inches in length, however, fish up to 18 inches were observed. <br> 
        Yellow Perch numbers are lower than desired which may be due to the high pike numbers. Perch can be an important food species for the Northern Pike and Walleye and can also be instrumental in helping maintain a well-balanced Bluegill population with fast growing, quality individuals.  Many anglers go to Thunder Lake seeking both Black Crappie and Bluegill.  While a few nice crappie were caught in the summer survey, fish over 12 inches were observed in spring electrofishing.  Bluegill abundance appears to be within the normal range when compared to similar type lakes.  The fish grow fast and reach 8 inches by age five.  The average size found in the survey was about 5 inches but there were some quality size Bluegills up to 9 inches caught. <br> 
 If looking for bullheads and not picky about size, Thunder Lake is an excellent lake to start with. Both the Black and Brown bullhead populations are high when compared to similar type lakes. Yellow Bullhead are also present but their numbers are much lower than the other two species.   Overall, Black Bullhead tended to be much smaller than the other species of bullhead. Black and Yellow bullhead are two species that can be indicators of water quality. Black Bullhead reach their highest abundance in very turbid, eutrophic waters while Yellow Bullhead prefer clear water.  Common Carp are present but do not appear to be at levels high enough to be detrimental to lake habitat.  Other fish species found in the survey included Bowfin (Dogfish), White Suckers, and Pumpkinseed. <br> 
 Despite having only light development around the lake and a watershed dominated by forest and marsh, late summer algae blooms have been common in Thunder Lake.  This is from natural eutrophication due to surrounding marshes.  The lake has experienced some severe winterkills in the past but winterkill in recent times appeared to be just partial die-offs. Minimizing impacts to the lake's undeveloped shorelines and plant communities is encouraged to provide fish and wildlife habitat and buffer the effects of land use practices. Anglers and spearers are encouraged to harvest small Northern Pike and to release larger pike over 24 inches to help maintain fish community balance.  Limiting harvest of the larger Black Crappie and male Bluegill will also help maintain a quality panfish fishery.   <br>

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/04/2007 Clarity: 5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Blueberry Lake is located in northern Wadena County, three miles northeast of Menahga.  Blueberry is a shallow lake with a surface area of 522 acres and a maximum depth of 15.0 feet.  The Blueberry and Shell Rivers enter the lake on the southwest shore.  The outlet of Blueberry Lake is the Shell River.  The water quality in Blueberry can be poor at times, and heavy algae blooms are common during summer months.  A high carp population in the lake also stirs up bottom sediments.  A state-owned public access is located on the northeast shore at the outlet channel (Shell River).  Blueberry Lake provides angling opportunities for walleye, northern pike, panfish, and carp. <br> 
 <br> 
The Minnesota Dept. of Natural Resources (DNR) has classified Minnesota's lakes into 43 different types based on physical, chemical, and other characteristics.  Blueberry Lake is in lake class 41.  There are no other class 41 lakes in the Park Rapids management area.  Portage Lake (3 miles north of Park Rapids) is in lake class 39 and has similar physical and chemical features to Blueberry and can be used for comparison. <br> 
 <br> 
Blueberry supports good populations of northern pike and walleye.  Northern pike abundance (12.3 pike/gillnet) was the highest recorded for all surveys on Blueberry.  Northern pike abundance was also high in the two previous surveys in 1997 and 2002.  Sampled NOP had an average length and weight of 22.5 inches and 2.7 pounds, with pike measured up to 32.6 inches.  A special regulation was implemented in the spring of 2003 that requires the release of all northern pike from 24.0 to 36.0 inches (protected slot length limit).  Future surveys are planned on Blueberry to evaluate the effectiveness of this regulation.  Walleye abundance (1.8 walleye/gillnet) was down from recent surveys and below the current management goal of 5 walleye/gillnet.  Blueberry Lake is stocked annually with walleye fry in the spring.  Special fall electrofishing sampling has shown good survival of stocked fry.  Blueberry Lake is shallow and fertile and provides a good forage base of yellow perch and other minnow species for the walleye and northern pike populations.  A few yellow perch are an acceptable size for angling, with perch measured up to 11.1 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
While not known as a panfish lake, Blueberry does provide fishing opportunities for black crappie and bluegill.  Low numbers of panfish are found in Blueberry and the lake is known more for quality than quantity of panfish.  Anglers will find black crappie in the 10-12 inch size range and bluegill in the 7-8 inch size range. <br> 
 <br> 
Blueberry Lake is one of the very few lakes in this area that has a carp population in high enough numbers to provide bowfishing and angling opportunities. <br> 
 <br> 
Other species sampled included high numbers of white sucker and shorthead redhorse and moderate numbers of brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, and bowfin (dogfish).  Black bullhead and hybrid sunfish were sampled in low numbers. <br>

 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/16/2009 Clarity: .5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Kansas is a 398-acre lake located southwest of St. James in Watonwan County.  The lake has a maximum depth of 7.0 feet and is a class 43 lake.  The lake is managed for walleye primarily while northern pike, yellow perch, and black crappie are managed secondarily.  A partial winterkill was suspected during the winter of 2007-08.  A Winterkill Assessment during the spring of 2008 indicated that yellow perch survived the low oxygen levels fairly well.  The lake was stocked with walleye and northern pike fry and northern pike fingerlings during the spring of 2008.  Walleye fingerlings, yearlings, and adults were stocked into the lake in 2009.  Oxygen levels dropped to below 2 ppm again during the winter of 2009-10. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye numbers were high when compared to other lakes with similar morphology and chemical characteristics.  Lengths of walleye caught in our gill nets ranged from 9.8 to 19.2 inches and averaged 13.1 inches.  The majority of walleye sampled (88% of the walleye sampled) were age 2 and were likely the result of a fry stocking in 2008.  The rest of the fish were age 3 and 4 which were likely the result of fingerling stockings in 2006 and 2007.  The strong year class of 12 inch walleye is the primary reason for the high gill net catch rate in 2009.  It is hopeful that since the walleye are small, low oxygen levels during the winter of 2009-10 will have a minimal impact on the walleye population. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch numbers were very high when compared to other lakes similar to Kansas.  Lengths of yellow perch sampled in gill nets ranged from 6.0 to 12.1 inches with an average length of 10.0 inches.  Many of the perch caught in our gill nets were in the 9.5 to 11.0 inch range. <br> 
 <br> 
Northern pike numbers were also high when compared to lakes similar to Kansas.  Lengths of northern pike caught in our gill nets ranged from 15.9 to 27.1 inches with an average length of 19.8 inches.  There were three northern pike sampled in trap nets that were over 30 inches in length. <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie numbers were what we would expect for lakes similar to Kansas.  Lengths of black crappie caught in our trap nets ranged from 4.1 to 9.8 inches with an average length of 6.6 inches.  There appears to be two year classes of black crappie present in the lake. <br> 
 <br> 
There are good numbers of black bullhead in Kansas for those who would like a meal of fresh bullhead.  Lengths of black bullhead caught in our trap nets ranged from 3.9 to 12.3 inches with an average length of 8.6 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
Other fish sampled during the assessment included bigmouth buffalo, common carp, yellow bullhead, and green sunfish.  <br> 
 <br> 
To maintain a healthy fishery in Kansas Lake, we need to promote Best Management Practices (BMPs) within the watershed to help reduce nutrients entering the lake.  High nutrients and sediments in a lake can cause algae blooms and reduce water clarity. <br>

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2014-06-23',  County Name = 'Watonwan', Lake Name = 'Long' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/23/2014 Clarity: 2.8' 
 Narrative = '<p>INTRODUCTION <br> 
Long Lake is a 264-acre lake located in Watonwan County, approximately 5.5 miles south of the City of St. James. The lake has a maximum depth of 13.0 feet and has a watershed-to-lake-ratio of 6 to 1. The lakes watershed is highly agricultural and much of Long Lake's shoreline has been altered by residential development. In areas with residential development, lawns are typically maintained to the water's edge and shorelines are altered with rock rip rap or sand blankets, which disrupt the natural riparian buffer. Agriculture and riparian development likely cause poor water quality in the form of algae blooms. Adding more nutrients to the system through a diversion pump from the South Fork of the Watonwan River likely does not help algal blooms.  In an effort to mitigate the algae blooms, Long Lake is sporadically treated with copper sulfate, temporarily improving water clarity. Copper sulfate treatments likely have adverse effects on the food web in Long Lake because it kills algae, the main food source for zooplankton and other aquatic invertebrates, which are prey for small fish, which are eventually prey for large predators such as walleye, northern pike, and largemouth bass. Long Lake is managed primarily for walleye and secondarily for black crappie, bluegill, largemouth bass, and yellow perch. A combination of walleye fingerlings, yearlings, and adults have been stocked in 2005, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, and 2012, with the current stocking regime calling for walleye frylings to be stocked two out of three years (2011, 2012, 2014, 2015). Other management species have not been stocked in recent years. A population assessment was conducted during the week of June 23, 2014 to monitor fish populations using three gill nets and seven trap nets.  <br> 
 <br> 
WALLEYE <br> 
Catch rates of walleye in Long Lake have historically been low, ranging from 0.0 per gill net in 2006 to 4.0 per gill net in 1985. In 2014, the walleye catch rate was 2.3 per gill net, which is low when compared to similar lakes. Since the early 1990s, various stocking strategies including fry, frylings, and fingerlings have been employed to increase walleye abundance, with little success. Currently, walleye frylings are being stocked two out of three years at a rate of 150 fish per littoral acre (2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018). Age estimates from otoliths (ear bones in walleyes) indicated the presence of four year-classes from 2006, 2010, 2011, and 2012. Three of the four year-classes correspond to years in which stocking occurred. The one walleye from the 2006 year-class (non-stocking year) may be a result of natural reproduction or was moved from another water body to Long Lake. Walleyes ranged from 11.1 to 24.1 inches and averaged 16.6 inches. Growth of walleye in Long Lake is slow. Mean length at age-3 for Long Lake walleye was 14.2 inches while the mean length for age-3 walleye from similar lakes was 17.7 inches. Walleyes were somewhat skinny, indicating that prey is available but not overly abundant. Although early indications are that this stocking strategy has not significantly increased walleye abundance, fryling stocking should continue until the next scheduled survey in 2018 to fully evaluate this strategy. <br> 
 <br> 
BLACK CRAPPIE <br> 
Black crappie abundance in Long Lake has been highly variable, with catch rates ranging from 0.0 per trap net in 1990 to 64.8 per trap net in 2002. In 2014, the black crappie catch rate was below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.5 per trap net) at 1.0 per trap net, down significantly from the 2010 catch rate of 23.8 per trap net. Black crappie ranged in length from 3.9 to 10.3 inches and averaged 6.1 inches. Black crappie appeared to be plump, indicating black crappie are foraging successfully. The decreased abundance of black crappie is likely a result of a lack of recruitment in recent years. Black crappie recruitment tends to be highly variable and is often characterized as cyclic, with strong year classes reoccurring every three to five years. This variable and cyclic recruitment often results in a "boom-or-bust" crappie fishery, where years of increased angler catch rates are followed by years of decreased angler catch rates.  <br> 
 <br> 
BLUEGILL <br> 
Similar to 2010 (0.9 per trap net), bluegill were captured at a rate of 0.7 per trap net in 2014 which is below the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.2 to 20.0 per trap net). Since 1990, bluegill catch rates have varied from 0.0 per trap net in 1990 to 35.9 per trap net in 2002, and have averaged 11.6 per trap net. Bluegills ranged in length from 3.2 to 7.0 inches and averaged 4.2 inches. Despite their low abundance and small size structure, bluegills appear to be reproducing in Long Lake, as evidence by 389 young-of-the-year (YOY) "sunfish" being captured in a July 2014 near shore survey.  <br> 
 <br> 
YELLOW PERCH <br> 
Long Lake's yellow perch population was at an all-time high in 1998 when they were captured at a rate of 51.0 per gill net. Since, the population gradually declined to 2.0 per gill net in 2010. It appears that the population has rebounded significantly in 2014, as yellow perch were captured at a rate of 20.3 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (2.7 to 25.0 per gill net). Despite the increase in catch rate, yellow perch were small, ranging from 5.3 to 10.2 inches and averaging 6.3 inches. The majority of yellow perch sampled were less than 6.5 inches in length (80 percent). Yellow perch were plump, indicating that they are foraging successfully. In two or three years, yellow perch should reach a length acceptable to anglers.  <br> 
 <br> 
LARGEMOUTH BASS <br> 
In 2014, largemouth bass were captured at a rate of 21.0 per hour, which is the highest bass electrofishing catch rate observed on Long Lake since 1995. Prior catch rates ranged from 2.0 per hour in 1998 to 8.0 per hour in 1995. Largemouth bass ranged in length from 6.2 to 21.0 inches and averaged 8.9 inches. Only three largemouth bass over 9.0 inches were sampled, with the majority (86 percent) being approximately 6.0 to 8.0 inches in length. Three year classes of largemouth bass were sampled including fish from 2013 (age-1), 2012 (age-2), and 2007 (age-7). Age-1 largemouth bass averaged 7.0 inches and age-2 bass averaged 8.0 inches. According to anglers and lakeshore owners, large bass are present and should continue to provide a good angling opportunity.  <br> 
 <br> 
OTHER SPECIES <br> 
Northern pike are not managed in Long Lake, but the population maintains itself at low levels. The 2014 catch rate was the same as the 2010 catch rate, 1.3 per gill net, which is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.1 to 8.0 per gill net). Northern pike lengths ranged from 18.0 to 25.0 inches and averaged 21.6 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
Black bullhead abundance has remained low since 1990. The trend continued in 2014, as the black bullhead catch rate (25.7 per gill net) did not exceed the low end of expected catch rates for similar lakes. Black bullheads ranged in length from 7.6 to 11.4 inches and averaged 10.4 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
Common carp abundance has steadily declined since the high in 1994 (25.2 per gill net) to 3.3 per gill net in 2014. This catch rate is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes. <br> 
Freshwater drum abundance in gill nets declined from 39.3 per gill net in 2010 to 8.7 per gill net in 2014. Conversely, trap net catches of freshwater drum increased from 2.4 per trap net in 2010 to 4.7 per trap net in 2014. Both gill net and trap net catch rates in 2014 exceed the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (8.3 per gill net; 3.3 per trap net). Freshwater drum ranged from 13.3 to 19.0 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.  By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain or improve water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> 
 <br> 
Best management practices within the watershed (no-till farming, cover crops, buffer strips, targeted fertilizer application, reduced or metered tiling) would help reduce nutrients entering the lake. High nutrient and sediment input can cause algae blooms and reduce overall water quality. Any improvements in the watershed are likely to have positive impacts on the fishery. <br>

 Narrative = '<p>INTRODUCTION <br> 
 <br> 
St. James Lake is a 252-acre lake located in the City of St. James in Watonwan County. St. James Lake has a maximum depth of 15.4 ft.  Historically, St. James Lake was characterized as having good water quality and abundant aquatic vegetation.  Suspected partial winterkills in the mid-1990's suppressed gamefish populations enough that rough fish populations were able to become well established, thereby negatively affecting the water quality and the aquatic vegetation community in St. James Lake. In 2001, a rotenone reclamation was done on St. James Lake to eliminate rough fish populations and reestablish game fish populations.  Following the reclamation in the spring of 2002, water clarity improved and aquatic vegetation was able to reestablish, providing excellent habitat for desirable fish species.  Installation of an additional aeration unit has helped to prevent winterkill in recent years, which has aided in stabilizing game fish populations.  St. James Lake is managed primarily for Largemouth Bass and Bluegill, and secondarily for Walleye, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and Yellow Perch.  Walleye fingerlings are stocked every other year (2011, 2013, 2015, 2017) at a rate of 2 pounds per acre.  The remaining management species have not been regularly stocked following the reclamation because they have maintained themselves through natural reproduction.  A standard survey was conducted the week of August 3, 2015 to monitor fish populations using two gill nets and nine trap nets. Largemouth Bass were electrofished the week of May 21, 2015 to monitor their population.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
LARGEMOUTH BASS <br> 
 <br> 
In years following the reclamation, Largemouth Bass catch rates have varied from 9.0 per hour in 2011 to 394.0 per hour in 2003, and have averaged 110.4 per hour since 2003.  In 2015, Largemouth Bass were captured at a rate of 27.0 per hour, which is within the desired range of 20-30 per hour, and is an increase from 18.4 per hour observed in 2013.  Largemouth Bass lengths ranged from 4.0 to 18.5 inches and averaged 12.8 inches.  During electrofishing in 2015, decent numbers of 4.0 to 6.5 inch bass were sampled suggesting that natural reproduction occurred in 2014.  Largemouth Bass were plump, suggesting that they are finding plenty of food.  Although not highly abundant, a fishable population of Largemouth Bass exists, with good numbers exceeding 17.0 inches.   <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
BLUEGILL <br> 
 <br> 
The 2015 Bluegill catch rate was 15.6 per trap net, up from 1.3 per trap net in 2013, and the highest Bluegill catch rate since the 2007 survey.  Since 1986, Bluegill catch rates have averaged 28.2 per trap net, and have ranged from 1.3 per trap net in 2013 to 101.9 per trap net in 2003.  The 2015 catch rate was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.9 to 29.5 per trap net).  Lengths of Bluegill ranged from 3.2 to 8.6 inches and averaged 6.9 inches.  Bluegill were plump, indicating that there is plenty of food available.  Multiple year classes of Bluegill are present, suggesting that natural reproduction occurs in St. James Lake.  The Bluegill population is relatively balanced; however, Bluegill larger than 9 inches are lacking, which could be a result of angler harvest. <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
NORTHERN PIKE <br> 
 <br> 
Since the all-time high catch rate of 31.3 Northern Pike per gill net in 2011, the catch rate declined to 26.0 per gill net in 2013 and to 21.0 per gill net in 2015, continuing to be much greater than expected catch rates for this area (0.1 to 3.0 per gill net).  Prior to the increase in Northern Pike abundance in 2011, catch rates were typically less than 2.3 per gill net. The extreme increase in abundance was the result of a strong naturally reproduced year class in 2010.  Northern Pike were 12.7 to 29.2 inches and averaged 20.8 inches. Relative weight differed between size categories of Northern Pike.  Northern Pike greater than 21.0 inches were skinny, indicating that they are not foraging successfully and may be stunted. Anglers should not be afraid to harvest northern pike on St. James Lake, as plenty are available, and thinning them out may result in better growth of remaining Pike.   <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
WALLEYE <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye catch rates on St. James Lake have varied from 0.5 per gill net in 1986 to 13.3 per gill net in 2007 and have averaged 4.2 per gill net since 1986.  The 2015 catch rate of 4.5 per gill net increased slightly from the 2013 catch rate of 4.0 and was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (2.0 to 13.3 per gill net).  Walleye lengths ranged from 15.3 to 18.4 inches and averaged 16.6 inches. The Walleye population in St. James Lake is dependent upon stocking as natural reproduction likely does not occur.  Growth of Walleye is fast in St. James Lake, as they were 17.0 inches by age-3.  The abundant Northern Pike population may be limiting the success of Walleye fingerling stockings, as fingerlings are likely vulnerable to predation by Northern Pike.  Walleye yearlings, which are typically larger than fingerlings, were stocked in 2015, and may be less vulnerable to predation because of their larger size.  A fishable population of Walleye is present, and if angler hooks into one, it should be a decent size.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
YELLOW PERCH <br> 
 <br> 
In 2015, Yellow Perch were captured at a rate of 8.5 per gill net, up slightly from 7.0 per gill net in 2013, but much lower than the catch rate of 67.3 per gill net observed in 2011.  The 2015 catch rate was within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes in the area (3.0 to 67.3 per gill net).  Yellow Perch were small, ranging from 6.0 to 7.9 inches and averaging 6.8 inches.  The Yellow Perch population is likely being controlled by the abundant Northern Pike population, as well as Walleye and Largemouth Bass populations.  Additionally, an increase in the Bluegill population may be creating competition between the two species.   <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
BLACK CRAPPIE <br> 
 <br> 
From 2009 to 2013, Black Crappie abundance was less than 1.0 per trap net. The catch rate increased to 4.2 per trap net in 2015, which is the highest catch rate observed since 2007 (10.7 per trap net), and is within the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (1.0 to 18.8 per trap net).  Black Crappie were small, ranging from 4.4 to 9.0 inches and averaging 6.9 inches.  It appears that the Black Crappie population in St. James Lake is mainly comprised of one abundant year class, with a few more year classes present in low numbers, which is typical of crappie populations.  Black Crappie should be a harvestable size within the next couple of years.  <br> 
 <br> 
 <br> 
OTHER SPECIES <br> 
 <br> 
Black Bullhead were sampled at a rate of 92.5 per gill net in 2015, slightly exceeding the expected range of catch rates for similar lakes (9.6 to 91.4 per gill net).  The 2015 catch rate was the highest catch rate since the reclamation in 2001, as catch rates since 2003 have not exceeded 2.7 per gill net.  The trap net catch rate remained relatively low at 1.2 per trap net, but was also the highest catch rate since the reclamation.  Black Bullhead were 4.8 to 10.7 inches and averaged 7.0 inches.  With a wide range of lengths present, it appears that Black Bullheads have successfully reestablished their population.  <br> 
 <br> 
Although not captured during August netting, Common Carp were observed while electrofishing in May 2015, which marks the first time that they have been sampled in St. James Lake since the reclamation in 2001.  <br> 
 <br> 
Plants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients.  Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place.

 Survey Date = '2009-06-29',  County Name = 'Wright', Lake Name = 'Albert' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/29/2009 Clarity: 1.2' 
 Narrative = '<p>Albert Lake is a natural environment lake with small size (53 acres) and a maximum depth of 47 feet.  An initial fisheries survey was done in 1973 with a resurvey in 1983, and population assessment in 1989.  Land for a public access has been acquired but not developed by the Parks and Trails Division. This was the first full lake survey since 1983. <br> 
 <br> 
Problems with degraded water quality and the abundance of pollution tolerant species like common carp were noted immediately.  The water clarity was slightly better than one foot in late June.   Most Wright County lakes maintain good clarity through June.  Total phosphorous concentrations were 0.103 ppm, a level that will result in nuisance algal blooms as the water warms.  Only one submersed vegetation species was noted, Sago Pondweed, and grew out to less than one foot in depth.  Concentrations of carp were observed in the shallows in May.  The gill net catch of carp was five times higher than the expected range.  Average size of carp was small suggesting a growing population.  Catches of panfish have varied widely likely due to instability in the fishery.  Yet Albert Lake does not appear to winterkill. <br> 
 <br> 
Anglers can expect fair fishing for largemouth bass and panfish.  Northern pike, while rare in the survey were above average in size, 25 inches and four pounds. <br> 
 <br> 
A total of 27 largemouth bass were collected during day-time electrofishing on 5/9/09.  Largemouth ranged in length from 7 - 18 inches with an average length of 14 inches.   <br> 
Bluegill (13.8/trap net) were within the range of expected values but average length was small, five inches.    Bluegill abundance has varied widely ranging from 56.0/trap (1983) to 2.5/trap (1989). <br> 
 <br> 
The catch rate of black crappie (14.8/trap net) was within the range of expected values for the lake class.  Black crappie were small, 6.7 inches, and weighed less than 0.2 pounds.  Like bluegill, the catch of crappies has varied considerably: 405.3/trap (1983), 67.8/trap (1983). <br> 
 <br> 
A total of six walleye were sampled in gill nets and trap nets.  Walleye ranged in length from 19 - 26 inches. No walleye have been sampled in previous assessments, and no stocking is known to have occurred. Two walleyes approximately 20 inches in length were determined to be seven years old. <br> 
 <br> 
Black bullheads (12.2/trap net, 40/gill net) were abundant though still within the range of expected values.  Black bullheads were small.   Average length and weight were 6.5 inches and 0.26 pounds.</p>'

INFORMATION:	
 Survey Date = '2011-07-25',  County Name = 'Wright', Lake Name = 'Dean' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 07/25/2011 Clarity: 2.2' 
 Narrative = '<p>Dean Lake is located 3.5 miles southeast of the city of Buffalo in southeastern Wright County. A public access with limited parking is located on the east side of the lake, adjacent to County Road 14. The lake is 173 acres, has an average depth of 10.4 feet and a maximum depth of 20 feet. The lake has poor water clarity and experiences heavy summer algal blooms. Dean Lake has experienced winterkills in the past, but not since 1997.  Since 2002 aeration equipment has been available. It was used in 2009 and 2010 to prevent winterkill. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye abundance was below average in 2011.  This was a reflection of poor walleye fry survival from 2002 to 2004. The stocking of larger fingerlings and yearlings between 2005 and 2007 did not contribute appreciably to the fishery.  Nonetheless, signs of an improving walleye fishery exist in Dean Lake.  The 2009 fingerling stocking was successful.  A large number of small walleye between 7 and 9 inches were sampled during spring electrofishing. However, these fish were too small to be effectively sampled by gill nets during the July netting. The average length and weight of walleye sampled was 15 inches and 1.5 pounds and growth was fast. The largest individual sampled was nearly 24 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
Few northern pike were captured, but the average size (25 inches, 3.5 pounds) was good and growth rates were high. Yellow perch were more abundant than expected for this lake type, likely resulting in the high growth rates observed for walleye and northern pike.  <br> 
 <br> 
The catch rate of largemouth bass was over 1.5 times higher than the day-time electrofishing average for Montrose Area lakes. The average size was 11.5 inches and growth was faster than average.  The largest individual was 19.5 inches.  <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie abundance was above average with over 1,300 crappies sampled.  The average length was nearly 8 inches and the largest crappie captured was 11 inches. Bluegill abundance was above average. The average length of bluegill was 7 inches and growth was above average.  <br> 
 <br> 
Smallmouth and white bass were sampled in low numbers.    This is the second record of a white bass  in Wright County.   The first record was an angler-reported white bass in 2003, also from Dean Lake. <br> 
 <br> 
Sportfish have benefitted from the successful winter aeration in recent years and fishing should be good for walleye and panfish in the near future. Land and lakeshore owners within the watershed can help improve water quality by using best management practices to reduce run-off and nutrient input to the lake.</p>'

 Survey Date = '2010-06-21',  County Name = 'Wright', Lake Name = 'Mud' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/21/2010 Clarity: 5' 
 Narrative = '<p>Skifstrom (Mud) Lake is a small (56 acres) eutrophic lake located about six miles north of the city of Cokato.  It has a maximum depth of 65 feet and poor water quality.  Secchi disk transparency was five feet and dissolved oxygen was good down to 21 feet.  The aquatic plant community is sparse.  Only ten species of emergent/submersed plants were identified with some submersed plants growing to a maximum depth of 11 feet.  Coontail was the only species that was abundant and showed up in all transects.  Curled pondweed abundance was low and found growing at or near the surface on less than 1% of the lake surface area.  There is a public access and fishing pier located within the county park on the east side of the lake. <br> 
 <br> 
Largemouth bass were sampled by daytime electrofishing on May 27, 2010.  Thirty-six largemouth bass were sampled in 0.70 hrs of electrofishing for a catch rate of 52/hr, which is one and a half times the median value (36/hr) for lakes sampled during the day in the Montrose area.  Largemouth bass ranged in length from 6 - 18 inches and averaged 12.3 inches and 1.1 lbs.  Growth of largemouth bass was similar to the statewide average with largemouth bass reaching 12 inches by age 4.  Anglers can expect good fishing for medium size largemouth bass with an occasional fish pushing 18 inches. <br> 
 <br> 
The gill net catch of northern pike (3.3/gill net) was similar to the 2001 catch (2.0/gill net), but within the range of expected values for similar lakes.  Northern pike sampled during the survey ranged from 23 - 32 inches and averaged 27 inches and 4.5 pounds.  Northern pike growth appears to be faster than the statewide average with northern pike reaching 24 inches by age 3.  Northern pike are not abundant, but the average size is good. <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye were sampled for the first time in 2010 even though there is no history of walleye stocking ever occurring on the lake. <br> 
 <br> 
The gill net catch of yellow perch (18.7/net) was above the range of expected values for similar lakes, however significantly lower than the peak years of 1983 (81/net) and 2001 (77/net).  Yellow perch ranged in length from 5 - 8 inches and averaged 6.5 inches.  Growth of yellow perch was similar to the statewide average with yellow perch reaching six inches by age 3. <br> 
 <br> 
The black crappie catch (1.0/trap net) was lower than 2001 (4.8/trap net) and below the first quartile value for similar lakes.  The black crappie population has been declining since the original survey in 1983.  Black crappie sampled during the survey ranged from 6 - 10 inches and averaged seven inches.  Growth of black crappie was similar to the statewide average with black crappie reaching eight inches by age 4.  Based on catches, the crappie population does not appear to be very abundant. <br> 
 <br> 
The bluegill catch (25.3/trap net) was lower than 2001 (33.9/trap net), but within the range of expected values for similar lakes.  Bluegills sampled during the survey ranged from 3 - 8 inches and averaged six inches.  Growth of bluegill was similar to the statewide average with bluegill reaching seven inches by age 5.  Sunfish angling on Skifstrom Lake runs in cycles with a couple of years of good fishing with a respectable average size followed by a few years of slow fishing with a smaller average size.  Right now, anglers can expect good fishing for sunfish with many keepers in the 7 - 8 inch range. <br> 
 <br> 
Other species sampled during the survey included: black bullhead, bowfin (dogfish), brown bullhead, central mudminnow, common carp, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, Iowa darter, Johnny darter, pumpkinseed sunfish, white sucker and yellow bullhead. <br>

 Survey Date = '1997-07-28',  County Name = 'Wright', Lake Name = 'Scott' 
 Lake Clarity = '' 
 Narrative = '<p>Scott Lake, Wright County, is an 80 acre lake with a maximum depth of 23 feet.  Alake survey conducted in 1997 sampled 14 species of fish.  Scott Lake may bedescribed as a hard-water lake of good fertility and moderate water quality.  Waterclarity as measured by secchi disk depth ranges from 1.0 to 4.4 feet in mid to latesummer.  Adequate dissolved oxygen was sampled to a depth of 11 feet.  It has alow diversity of aquatic plants growing in sparse beds around the lake.Scott Lake is managed primarily as a black crappie and northern pike fishery. However, since it has no public access, it is not managed in the same way as lakesthat do.  Scott Lake has not been stocked since 1992, relying instead upon naturalreproduction and migration from other lakes in the Clearwater Chain.  The lakesometimes suffers from low winter oxygen, and has experienced partial winterkills. Bullhead, carp, sucker and dogfish were commercially harvested in 1984.  Samplesof the fish population were taken in mid summer using gill nets and trap nets. Game fish catches were poor for this type of lake; many species decreased comparedto previous surveys.Gillnets sampled 19 channel catfish for a catch rate of 4.8 per lift.  Channelcatfish were last sampled in Scott Lake in 1986.  The trapnet catch of 1.0 per setwas the first recorded.  Catfish ranged in size from 15 to 27 inches, averagingabout 19 inches long.  Of adults sampled, 92% were at least 16 inches, with 3.6%at least 24 inches long.  There is no record of channel catfish having been stockedinto Scott Lake; they have probably entered from other lakes via the ClearwaterRiver.Catches of panfish were lower than expected for a lake of this type.  Bluegillswere sampled in trapnets at a rate of 12.1 per set, below average but within thenormal range.  No bluegill were sampled in gillnets, but this is not unusual. Bluegills ranged in size from 3 to 7 inches, averaging about 5.5 inches.  About38.6% of the adults were larger than 6 inches.  Black crappies were sampled at therate of 3.9 per trapnet set, below average but again within the normal range forlakes of this type.  Historic catches of bluegill and black crappies have beenhighly variable.The survey sampled 18 northern pike, for a catch rate of 1.5 per gillnet lift and1.3 per trapnet set.  The gillnet catch rate was below average, but within thenormal range for this lake type.  Northern pike ranged in size from 18 to 28inches, with an average size of about 23.6 inches.  All pike sampled were adults;87.5% were at least 21 inches long.  Walleyes were sampled at the rate of 1.3 pergillnet lift and 0.2 per trapnet set.  Walleye catch rates for both net types werebelow average, but within the normal range.  Walleyes measured from 18 to 26inches, averaging about 21 inches long.  All walleye sampled were at least 15inches long, with 57.1% at least 20 inches in length.  Historic catches of bothwalleye and northern pike have been highly variable.</p>'

 Survey Date = '2012-06-13',  County Name = 'Yellow Medicine', Lake Name = 'Tyson' 
 Lake Clarity = 'Date: 06/13/2012 Clarity: 3' 
 Narrative = '<p>A fish population assessment was conducted during mid-June of 2012 in Tyson Lake. Tyson is a small (147 acres), shallow (8 feet maximum depth), periodically aerated, and productive lake located in Yellow Medicine County. Residential development is limited to one farm site on the south shore. Water levels were normal to high during the 2012 assessment, but 1-2 feet below normal by fall due to drought conditions. Nutrient runoff into Tyson is from agricultural row crops. Tyson Lake is connected to a shallow wetland along the east shore. Water clarity was fair during June of 2012 (3.0 feet). Blue-green algae blooms are common and intense in Tyson Lake. A light algae bloom was present during the 2012 assessment. A partial summerkill of primarily black bullhead, fathead minnows, and orangespotted sunfish occurred in July of 2002. Submergent vegetation is limited to primarily sago pondweed, water moss, and filamentous algae, especially in the near shore areas. Sago pondweed was abundant in Tyson during 2012. Emergent vegetation consists mainly of bulrush and cattail species scattered throughout the shoreline areas. Tyson Lake is managed for walleye as primary species. Walleye fry are generally stocked into Tyson every other year. If a fry stocking is a failure, then the lake will generally be stocked again with fry the following spring. <br> 
 <br> 
Yellow perch numbers were low in 2012 (0.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges of Tyson and similar lakes. Yellow perch abundance in the 2012 trapnets was also low (0.50 fish/trapnet). The yellow perch historical average catch rate is 4.69 fish/gillnet for Tyson. The 2012 yellow perch size was small to moderate (0.17 pounds and 6.86 inches) from gillnets and trapnets combined. The yellow perch historical average length is 8.15 inches from gillnets and trapnets combined.  <br> 
 <br> 
Bluegill were not captured in 2012 trapnets or gillnets. The bluegill historical catch rate is 2.87 fish/trapnet for Tyson. Adult bluegill (2,037 fish, 291 pounds) were last stocked in Tyson during July of 2004. <br> 
 <br> 
Black crappie numbers were low in 2012 (0.25 fish/trapnet) compared to the normal range for similar lakes. The black crappie historical average catch rate is 0.08 fish/trapnet for Tyson. The 2012 black crappie average size was large (0.84 pounds and 11.40 inches) from trapnets. Black crappie growth rates were above the Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5. The black crappie captured in the 2012 assessment were from the 2009 and 2007 year classes. <br> 
 <br> 
Green sunfish numbers were low in 2012 (0.38 fish/trapnet). The green sunfish historical average catch rate is 0.93 fish/trapnet for Tyson. The 2012 green sunfish average size was moderate (0.17 pounds and 5.75 inches) from trapnets. Orangespotted sunfish abundance was also low in 2012 (0.25 fish/trapnet) and below the Tyson historical average catch rate (5.25 fish/trapnet). Hybrid sunfish abundance was also low in 2012 (0.13 fish/trapnet), but similar to the historical average (0.09 fish/trapnet).  <br> 
 <br> 
Walleye numbers were abundant in 2012 gillnets (40.50 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges for Tyson and similar lakes. Walleye numbers were also abundant in 2012 trapnets (7.25 fish/trapnet). The walleye historical average catch rates are 8.22 fish/gillnet and 2.91 fish/trapnet for Tyson. The 2012 walleye average size was small to moderate (1.04 pounds and 12.01 inches) from gillnets. The 2012 walleye average size was small (0.40 pounds and 9.72 inches) from trapnets. The walleye historical average weights are 1.53 pounds from gillnets and 1.26 pounds from trapnets. The 2012 catch rate of quality size (15.00 inches) and larger walleye was high (13.00 fish/gillnet) in the 2012 gillnets. The 2012 catch rate of preferred size (20.00 inches) and larger walleye was moderate (3.00 fish/gillnet) in the 2012 gillnets. Walleye growth rates for Tyson were near the upper end of Spicer Area normal ranges for ages 1-5, but below the normal ranges for ages 6-7. The 2011 and 2008 walleye year classes (fry stocked) comprised 61% and 25% respectively of the 2012 walleye catch. Individual walleye captured from the 2008 year class appeared in robust condition. Walleye natural reproduction in Tyson is generally infrequent and insignificant based on previous fall and summer surveys.  <br> 
 <br> 
A fall electrofishing survey was last conducted in 2011 to evaluate a spring walleye fry stocking (147,044 fry). There were moderate to low numbers of young of year "YOY" walleye (30.00 YOY/hour, 5.59 inches average length) captured in the 2011 fall electrofishing survey. Low numbers of YOY walleye (6.00 YOY/hour, 7.95 inches average length) were captured in 2010. The highest Tyson YOY walleye catch rate (378.46 YOY/hour, 4.92 inches average length) occurred in 2008. The Tyson Lake fall electrofishing historical average catch rate and length are 91.56 YOY/hour and 6.19 inches respectively. The Spicer Area YOY walleye historical average catch rate is 81.31 YOY/hour from lakes fry stocked and lakes with natural reproduction. Walleye yearlings and adults were last stocked in Tyson during 2003 (434 pounds and 1,304 fish). Walleye fry have been stocked into Tyson during 1998, 2000, 2002-2003, 2005, 2007-08 and 2010-2011.  <br> 
 <br> 
Black bullhead numbers were abundant in 2012 (320.00 fish/gillnet) compared to the normal ranges of Tyson and similar lakes. The black bullhead historical average catch rate is 209.53 fish/gillnet for Tyson. The 2012 black bullhead average size was moderate (0.32 pounds and 8.00 inches) from gillnets. The black bullhead historical average weight is 0.32 pounds from gillnets. Moderate numbers (48.25 fish/trapnet) of large black bullhead (0.56 pounds and 8.98 inches average size) were captured in the 2012 trapnets. <br> 
 <br> 
Current fish management activities on Tyson include monitoring the fish population on a periodic basis, monitoring winter dissolved oxygen levels, assisting the Wood Lake Sportsman's Club with the operation of the aeration system, protecting aquatic vegetation through the permit process, assisting aquatic plant management and enforcement personnel in educating boaters and monitoring access sites for potential invasive species introductions, participating in local watershed initiatives, and stocking various fish species as warranted. The Tyson fishery will be sampled in the fall of 2013 for YOY walleye. <br>
