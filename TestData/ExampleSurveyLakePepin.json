WALLEYE CATCH /LIFT HAS DECLINED EACH YEAR SINCE 1982. YELLOW PERCH CATCH/LIFT IS THE SECOND LOWEST RECORDED DURING THE PERIOD OF RECORD. SAU- GER CATCH/LIFT WAS CLOSE TO AVERAGE. LAKE LEVELS WERE EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH DURING THE 1986 SAMPLING PERIOD WHICH MAY HAVE AFFECTED GILL NET EFFICIENCY SUCCESS OF THE WALLEYE FISHERY IN PEPIN IS HIGHLY CORRELATED TO ABUNDANCE OF AGE II AND III WALLEYE (THORN 1984.) IF THIS HOLDS TRUE, POOR WALLEYE FISHING SUCCESS CAN BE EXPECTED DURING THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS ON THE BASIS OF GILLNET CATCH. ELECTROFISHING DATA INDICATES AN AVERAGE WALLEYE YEAR CLASS FOR 1986. SUCCESS OF THE SAUGER FISHERY IS ALSO CORRELATED TO SAUGER ABUNDANCE (AGE I,II AND III) (THORN 1984). ON THE BASIS OF GILL NET CATCH, FAIR SAUGER FISHING CAN BE EXPECTED FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS. ELECTROFISHING DATA (NOT CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT) INDICATES AN AVG SAUGER YEAR CLASS FOR 1986.</p>",

Sauger gill net catch was above average and sauger size was excellent.  Young-of-the-year fall electrofishing indicated good numbers of both walleye and sauger, which suggest a good 2006 year-class.  In addition, white bass, largemouth and smallmouth bass, bluegill, and crappie populations appear healthy in Pool 4, therefore no changes in management strategies are recommended or warranted at this time. </p>",

        "narrative": "<p>Lake Pepin is a natural lake that is entirely within Pool 4 of the Mississippi River.  The lake was formed by an alluvial (sediment) dam at the mouth of the Chippewa River.  Lake Pepin is approximately 25,000 acres and Pool 4 is close to 40,000 acres <br> \n <br> \nAngling effort averages about 460,000 hours annually and has been as high as 660,000 hours.   This works out to an average of about 13.5 hours of fishing activity for each acre of water on an annual basis.  On a per acre basis, this is very similar to other large Minnesota lakes like Winnibigoshish, Leech and Mille Lacs. <br> \n <br> \nFishing season for walleye, sauger, bass, and northern pike open year-round \u0013 which differs from inland waters that have a closed season from March 1 to mid-May in Minnesota. <br> \n <br> \nThere are over 120 fish species known to exist in this portion of the Mississippi River.  <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rate in the 2010 gill net survey was 5/net, which is above the long term average.  The 2009 walleye year class was excellent and may be as large as the 2001, which was one of the best on record.  The 2009 year class fish should start showing up on anglers lines in 2011.  Walleye from the 2009 year class averaged about 14 inches long in October of 2010, so there will probably be a lot of \"short\" fish in spring and early summer of 2011.  However, most of these fish will grow past the 15\" minimum by mid-summer.  Overall the walleye population is in excellent shape and there should be good fishing in 2011 and beyond. <br> \n <br> \nSauger numbers and overall size structure continue to be excellent.  Catch rate in 2010 (37/net) was above the long term average and up substantially from 2009.  Size of sauger was excellent, with many fish in the 14-17 inch range.  Large sauger (18\u001322 inches) were also well represented in the gill net sample.  Reproduction and recruitment of sauger has been very stable over the last 15-20 years and this has yielded consistently good fishing and an excellent size structure.  Based on the numbers and average size in last year's sample, sauger fishing in 2011 could be outstanding.  <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of white bass in 2010 (1.9/gill net) was well below the long term average of 4.7/ net.  The cause for the low catch rate is not known, but high water levels in October 2010 may have affected been a factor.  Catch rate of white bass has steadily declined since 2005.  Potential causes of this decline include a series of weak year classes, changes in habitat and water quality, and harvest. <br> \n <br> \nRecent aging of white bass using otoliths (inner ear bones) showed that white bass live much longer than originally thought.  Most white bass are less than 8 years old, but we have confirmed ages up to 15 years.  White bass grow very quickly to about 15\" and then growth slows dramatically.  Most fish that are 15\" and smaller are less than 8 years old, but if they are over 15\" long they could be anywhere from 6 to 15 years old. <br> \n</p>",

White bass abundance remains relatively low in comparison to the abundance seen during the 1980s.  Angling success during 1999 was reportedly very good for anglers seeking walleyes, saugers, and smallmouth bass.  The abundance forecast for these three species is favorable for the next few years.</p>",

        "narrative": "<p>Most adult gamefish populations were abundant as evidenced through gill net and electrofishing samples.  Walleye gill net catch was nearly double the long-term average.  Many age-1 walleye were captured in the gill nets and we observed the highest catch rates of young-of-the-year walleye in the fall electrofishing samples, which both indicate good 2006 and 2007 year-classes.  Sauger gill net catch was average and sauger size was excellent.  It also appeared that 2006 and 2007 year-classes of sauger were good.   In addition, white bass, largemouth and smallmouth bass, bluegill, and crappie populations appear healthy in Pool 4, therefore no changes in management strategies are recommended or warranted at this time.</p>",

        "narrative": "<p>Angling Forecast: <br> \nAnglers in 2019 experienced unprecedented disruptions to their angling year due to extensive high water.  A complete closure of accesses from the end of March to the beginning of May was only broken by six days of minimal access use through Everts Resort in upper Pool 4.  It was not until mid-June that all boat ramps were open. Subsequent high water events in July and October-November caused additional access closures.  The 2019 Large Lake Creel showed that these changes to accesses appear to have caused a change in angler priorities.  Casual anglers were less prevalent with <1% of anglers interviewed seeking \"No particular species\" and over 90% seeking Walleye, which differed from previous surveys (Schlesser 2014).  The creel also verified abundant numbers of sublegal Walleye from the 2018 year class which made up ~40% of Walleye reported in the creel.  These 2018 fish will, in general, start the year below the 15\" minimum length limit, but should grow to harvestable size by mid-summer.  <br> \n <br> \nThe 2020 outlook for Walleye and Sauger anglers should be positive.  The 2013 year class of Sauger continues to contribute to catches providing 4.1% of the 2019 gill-net catch.  During the 2020 angling season these fish and those from the three older year classes sampled in 2019 should provide opportunities for >20\" Sauger.  The 2015 year class (22% of the 2019 gill-net catch) will also provide numbers of Sauger from 15-20 inches as they grow in 2020.  Likely strong reproduction of both Walleye and Sauger in 2018 and 2019 has led to numerous reports of their capture as YOY by anglers both on open water and through the ice.  Anglers should expect to encounter higher than normal numbers of Walleye and Sauger that are less than 10 inches early in the season and the 10-15 inch range later as these groups grow. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass, Yellow Perch, Black Crappie, and Bluegill should continue to provide excellent angling opportunities during 2020 based on the numbers of adult and juvenile fish sampled.  The consistent Bluegill and Yellow Perch reproduction observed since 2004 should continue to provide good angling opportunities with quality sized fish available in 2020.  Four apparent strong year classes (2012-2014 and 2018) of Black Crappie will enhance an already productive crappie fishery with individuals recruiting to the creel for the next several years. These fish should be considered harvestable by anglers, but smaller sizes will also be present and as always sorting will likely be required.  Northern Pike numbers rose above the third quartile after several down years, which should provide ample opportunities for Northern Pike fishing throughout Pool 4.  Abundant food sources can rapidly grow pike to preferred and even trophy size when favorable conditions occur. <br> \n <br> \nThe start of the 2015 angling season on March 1st, 2015 represented the first time since the early 1990's that anglers were allowed to legally target Lake Sturgeon in Pool 4.  Wisconsin opened a season matching Minnesota's on their shared border waters in 2016.  After three open water seasons of catch and release angling for Lake Sturgeon on Pool 4, local interest in the species seems to be increasing.  Anglers on several occasions assisted DNR staff in their tagging efforts by providing hook and line caught individuals for tagging.   <br> \n <br> \nRegulations: <br> \nThe first comprehensive public review of bag and size limits in over fifty years was initiated in 2018 on the Mississippi River portion of the border waters between Minnesota and Wisconsin.  After collecting input from nearly 2000 total surveys (electronic and meetings combined) proposed regulations were developed by Department of Natural Resources staff from both Minnesota and Wisconsin.  The Wisconsin Conservation Congress Spring Hearings in 2019 showed strong support for all proposals, verifying what had been found by the second round of surveys (N=1225) conducted in 2018.  <br> \n <br> \nThe new regulations were approved by both states and went into effect in Minnesota on February 24th, 2020 and in Wisconsin on April 1st, 2020. <br> \n</p>",

        "narrative": "<p>Anglers in 2021 experienced \"low\" water levels not seen since the late 1980s.  These levels presented challenges to anglers whose experience on Pool 4 only took place during the last decade or so when \"high water\" has been the norm, but strong populations of multiple gamefish species particularly Walleye and Black Crappie were enjoyed by many. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2022 outlook for Walleye and Sauger anglers is very positive.  Ten year classes from age-3 through age-12 contributed Sauger >20-inches in the 2021 gill nets.  During the 2022 angling season these fish should provide opportunities for Sauger >20-inches.  The 2018 year class (25.7% of the 2021 gill-net catch) will also provide numbers of Sauger from 15-21 inches as they grow in 2022.  Strong reproduction of Walleye in 2018, 2019, and 2020 and Sauger in 2018 and 2020 led to numerous reports of their capture as YOY by anglers both on open water and through the ice in 2020.  Those fish from 2020 (25.7% of the Walleye and 50.2% of the Sauger caught in the 2021 gill nets) will provide numerous smaller fish 13-19 inches for Walleye and 10-17 inches for Sauger in 2022.   <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass, Yellow Perch, Black Crappie, and Bluegill should continue to provide excellent angling opportunities during 2022 based on the numbers of adult and juvenile fish sampled.  The consistent Bluegill and Yellow Perch reproduction observed since 2004 should continue to provide good angling opportunities with quality sized fish available in 2022.  Four apparent strong year classes (2012-2014 and 2018) of Black Crappie will enhance an already productive crappie fishery with individuals recruiting to the creel for the next several years.  In late 2021 these fish were available in large numbers from 10-14 inches in length, so in 2022 anglers should find plenty of harvestable fish, but smaller sizes will also be present and as always sorting will likely be required.  Northern Pike numbers remain above the third quartile, likely as a result of high water, abundant forage, and extensive spawning opportunities.  Anglers should have ample opportunities to target Northern Pike throughout Pool 4 as abundant food sources rapidly grow pike to preferred and even trophy size when favorable conditions occur. <br> \n <br> \nThe start of the 2015 angling season on March 1, 2015 represented the first time since the early 1990's that anglers were allowed to legally target Lake Sturgeon in Pool 4.  Wisconsin opened a season matching Minnesota's on their shared border waters in 2016.  After seven open water seasons of catch and release angling for Lake Sturgeon on Pool 4, local interest in the species continues to increase.  Anglers have, on several occasions, assisted DNR staff in their tagging efforts by providing hook and line caught individuals for tagging.  Once COVID protocols allow this method should be used to continue expanding the tagged population of Lake Sturgeon in the system. <br> \n <br> \nRegulations <br> \nThe first comprehensive public review of bag and size limits in over fifty years was initiated in 2018 on the Mississippi River portion of the border waters between Minnesota and Wisconsin.  After collecting input from nearly 2000 total surveys (electronic and meetings combined) proposed regulations were developed by Department of Natural Resources staff from both Minnesota and Wisconsin.  The Wisconsin Conservation Congress Spring Hearings in 2019 showed strong support for all proposals, verifying what had been found by the second round of surveys (N=1225) conducted in 2018.  <br> \n <br> \nThe new regulations were approved by both states and went into effect in Minnesota on February 24, 2020 and in Wisconsin on April 1, 2020.  Reports from conservation officers and members of the public have indicated that the new regulations have been greeted with very high acceptance by the public. <br> \n</p>",

On a per acre basis, this is very similar to other large Minnesota lakes like Winnibigoshish, Leech, and Mille Lacs. <br> \n <br> \nBy total number, Sauger and white bass are the most commonly caught and harvested species.  Walleye are generally third or fourth in total number.  Bluegill, Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike have all experienced excellent year classes in the recent past due to clear water and abundant aquatic vegetation and will continue to provide excellent opportunities in the next several years. <br> \n <br> \nThere are also many other fish species in Lake Pepin.  There are over 120 fish species known to exist in this portion of the Mississippi River.  <br> \n <br> \nThe fishing season for Walleye, Sauger, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and Northern Pike is open year-round, which differs from inland waters that have a closed season for these species from March 1 to mid-May in Minnesota.  The \"border waters\" of Pool 4 where the MN/WI border water regulations apply are bounded by LD3 and LD4 on the up- and down-stream ends respectively, and by the railroad tracks that run parallel to the river on the MN and WI shorelines.  <br> \n <br> \nHighlights from 2013 Lake Pepin Large Lake Survey: <br> \n <br> \nWalleye <br> \n\"  Walleye from the 2010 year class averaged 19.2\" long in October of 2013. <br> \n\"  The 2012 Walleye year class averaged 13.3\" long and will no doubt lead to many \"short fish\" in the beginning of the season.  Most of these fish, however, will grow past the 15\" minimum by mid- to late-summer and begin to contribute to angler harvest. <br> \n\"  Overall the Walleye population is in good shape and there should be good fishing in 2013 and beyond. <br> \n <br> \nSauger <br> \n\"  With the exception of 2011-2013 catch rates have been above average since 1998. <br> \n\"  Poor recruitment in 2010-12 due to low water levels, but a good year class in 2013 may boost catches in a few years. <br> \n\"  As with Walleye preliminary indications from night electrofishing in November are that low water in the spring hampered the 2012 Sauger spawn, producing a \"weak\" year class of Sauger for 2012, but the 2013 catch rate was the 2nd highest on record. <br> \n\"  Sauger from the 2010 year class (Age-3) averaged 15.4\" long in October of 2013. <br> \n\"  The 2011 year class averaged 13.7\" long and is the source of many of the small Sauger caught this past fall and winter in the tail water fishery at LD3. <br> \n\"  Over the next several years these fish will grow into the larger Sauger that people have been missing since the large year classes of the early 2000s expired. <br> \n\"  We will be watching closely over the next several years to see if the potentially strong 2013 year class or a series of average year classes can boost catch rates. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Bass <br> \n\"  Early results from our White Bass tagging study show that Pool 4 White Bass travel to Pools 3 and 5 and as far upstream as the Apple River in WI.  This travel may be a cause of the fluctuating gill net catch numbers because if fish are not in Pool 4 when netting occurs there is no chance of encountering them. <br> \n\"  We recently began aging White Bass using otoliths (inner ear bones) instead of scales.  This method is much more accurate particularly for older fish and allowed us to discover that though most White Bass in Lake Pepin are less than Age-8, they can live to be at least Age-17. <br> \n\"  White bass grow quickly to ~14\" by Age-4 and then become sexually mature and grow much slower for the rest of their lives. <br> \n <br> \nBluegill <br> \n\"  Excellent year class of Bluegill produced in 2011. <br> \n\"  The 2011 Bluegill will start 2014 averaging 6-7\" inches in length, but should reach an average of nearly 8\" by the fall of 2014. <br> \n\"  Excellent numbers of Bluegill from the 2011 and other year classes will likely lead to excellent pan fishing in years to come. <br> \n\"  The harsh winter 2013-14 likely caused some backwater winterkill. <br> \n <br> \nBlack Crappie <br> \n\"  Highest ever catch of YOY Black Crappie in the 2012 trawling survey. <br> \n\"  The large 2012 year class should reach ~9.5\" by the end of 2014 and almost 12\" by the end of 2016. <br> \n\"  Excellent fishing reported by anglers in 2012-13 should continue into 2014 and the good reproduction in 2012 and 2013 means it should continue for the next few years at least. <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch <br> \n\"  Yellow Perch numbers are down from their record high in 2011, but remain well above the 1986-Present median and 3rd quartile.  Numbers greater than 10\" are ties for all time high with 2011. <br> \n\"  Several years of good reproduction likely due to increasing water clarity and submerged weed growth has led to a good population of Yellow Perch that has both numbers and size for anglers in 2014. <br> \n\"  As with other species in Lake Pepin growth is fast and life spans are often shorter than in more northern bodies of water. <br> \n\"  Good perch fishing opportunities should continue in 2014 both on Lake Pepin and the river and its backwaters <br> \n <br> \nFor more information, contact: <br> \n  <br> \nLarge Lake Specialist (Lake Pepin) <br> \nNick Schlesser <br> \nDNR Area Fisheries Headquarters <br> \n1801 S.

        "narrative": "<p>Anglers in 2020 experienced the first \"normal\" water levels in recent years, and combined with COVID related shutdowns resulted in a wave of fishing pressure during the early summer that has not seen for some time on the river.  Enough pressure was noted that even critics of the new border waters regulations that went into effect in the spring of 2020 came forward in support of the reduced bag limits potential to limit impacts to current Walleye and Sauger stocks. <br> \n <br> \nThe 2021 outlook for Walleye and Sauger anglers is very positive.  Seven year classes from age-4 through age-11 contributed Sauger >20\" in the 2020 gill nets.  During the 2021 angling season these fish and those from the 2017 year class should provide opportunities for >20\" Sauger.  The 2018 year class (41.5% of the 2020 gill-net catch) will also provide numbers of Sauger from 15-19 inches as they grow in 2021.  Strong reproduction of Walleye in 2018, 2019, and 2020 and Sauger in 2018 and 2020 has led to numerous reports of their capture as YOY by anglers both on open water and through the ice.  Anglers should expect to encounter higher than normal numbers of Walleye and Sauger that are less than 10 inches early in the season and the 10-15 inch range later as these groups grow. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass, Yellow Perch, Black Crappie, and Bluegill should continue to provide excellent angling opportunities during 2021 based on the numbers of adult and juvenile fish sampled.  The consistent Bluegill and Yellow Perch reproduction observed since 2004 should continue to provide good angling opportunities with quality sized fish available in 2021.  Four apparent strong year classes (2012-2014 and 2018) of Black Crappie will enhance an already productive crappie fishery with individuals recruiting to the creel for the next several years.  In late 2020 these fish were available in large numbers from 10-14 inches in length, so in 2021 anglers should find plenty of harvestable fish, but smaller sizes will also be present and as always sorting will likely be required.  Northern Pike numbers continued to rise precipitously, likely as a result of high water and extensive spawning opportunities.  Anglers should have ample opportunities to target Northern Pike throughout Pool 4 as abundant food sources rapidly grow pike to preferred and even trophy size when favorable conditions occur. <br> \n <br> \nThe start of the 2015 angling season on March 1st, 2015 represented the first time since the early 1990's that anglers were allowed to legally target Lake Sturgeon in Pool 4.  Wisconsin opened a season matching Minnesota's on their shared border waters in 2016.  After five open water seasons of catch and release angling for Lake Sturgeon on Pool 4, local interest in the species continues to increase.  Anglers have, on several occasions, assisted DNR staff in their tagging efforts by providing hook and line caught individuals for tagging.  Once COVID protocols allow this method should be used to continue expanding the tagged population of Lake Sturgeon in the system. <br> \n <br> \nRegulations: <br> \n <br> \nThe first comprehensive public review of bag and size limits in over fifty years was initiated in 2018 on the Mississippi River portion of the border waters between Minnesota and Wisconsin.  After collecting input from nearly 2000 total surveys (electronic and meetings combined) proposed regulations were developed by Department of Natural Resources staff from both Minnesota and Wisconsin.  The Wisconsin Conservation Congress Spring Hearings in 2019 showed strong support for all proposals, verifying what had been found by the second round of surveys (N=1225) conducted in 2018.  <br> \n <br> \nThe new regulations were approved by both states and went into effect in Minnesota on February 24th, 2020 and in Wisconsin on April 1st, 2020 (see current regulations booklet for the new broder water regulations).  All reports from conservation officers and members of the public have indicated that the new regulations have been greeted with near universal acceptance. <br> \n</p>",

        "narrative": "<p>Lake Pepin is a natural lake that is entirely within Pool 4 of the Mississippi River. The lake was formed by an alluvial (sediment) dam at the mouth of the Chippewa River. Lake Pepin is approximately 25,000 acres and Pool 4 is close to 40,000 acres <br> \n <br> \nAngling effort averages about 460,000 hours annually and has been as high as 660,000 hours. This works out to an average of about 13.5 hours of fishing activity for each acre of water on an annual basis. On a per acre basis, this is very similar to other large Minnesota lakes like Winnibigoshish, Leech and Mille Lacs. <br> \n <br> \nFishing season for walleye, sauger, bass, and northern pike open year-round which differs from inland waters that have a closed season from March 1 to mid-May in Minnesota. <br> \n <br> \nThere are over 120 fish species known to exist in this portion of the Mississippi River. <br> \n <br> \nWalleye catch rate in the 2011 gill net survey was 4.2/net, which is above the long term average. The 2009 walleye year class was excellent and should provide anglers with good numbers of 17-20 inch fish in 2012.  Overall the walleye population is in excellent shape and there should be good fishing in 2012 and beyond. <br> \n <br> \nSauger numbers and overall size structure continue to be excellent. Catch rate in 2011 (20/net) was a significant decrease from the 2010 catch, but remained within normal variability for the population. Size of sauger was good, with many fish in the 14-17 inch range. Large sauger (18-23 inches) were also represented in the gill net sample. Reproduction and recruitment of sauger has been very stable over the last 15-20 years and this has yielded consistently good fishing and an excellent size structure.  <br> \n <br> \nThe high water of 2011 may have contributed to excellent reproduction for walleye and sauger, which were both sampled at above average rates during fall electrofishing surveys. <br> \n <br> \nYellow perch catch in the gill nets reached an all time high in 2011 with an average of 14/net. Good size structure and large individuals are available to those willing to seek out the perch in 2012.  The 2011 gillnet catch contained yellow perch up to 13.5 inches that exhibited fast growth with many perch reaching 10 inches in length by age-2.  <br> \n <br> \nExtended high water in 2010 and 2011 combined with increased water clarity noted in those same years has led to more vegetation particularly in the lower part of Lake Pepin.  This vegetation is likely a driver in the record catch of yellow perch and the near record catch of northern pike in the 2011 gill nets.  Additionally excellent spawning opportunities provided by the vegetation likely contributed to our record catch of young of the year bluegill when trawling in 2011 at an astonishing rate of 520 times our long term average and nearly 70 times our previous record catch rate.  If these young fish experience good survival bluegill fishing should continue to be excellent for several years on Lake Pepin. <br> \n <br> \nThe catch rate of white bass in 2011 (5.8/gill net) was above the long term average of 4.7/ net.  Catch rate of white bass had been steadily declining since 2005 before bumping up in 2011. Potential causes of this decline include a series of weak year classes, changes in habitat and water quality, and harvest. <br> \n <br> \nRecent aging of white bass using otoliths (inner ear bones) showed that white bass live much longer than originally thought. Most white bass are less than 8 years old, but we have confirmed ages up to 15 years. White bass grow very quickly to about 15\" and then growth slows dramatically. Most fish that are 15\" and smaller are less than 8 years old, but if they are over 15\" long they could be anywhere from 6 to 15 years old. </p>",

        "narrative": "<p>Angler Effort averages about 460,000 hours annually and has been as high as 660,000 hours. This works out to an average of about 13.5 hours of fishing activity for each acre of water on an annual basis. On a per acre basis, this is very similar to other large Minnesota lakes like Winnibigoshish, Leech, and Mille Lacs. <br> \n <br> \nBy total number, Sauger and White Bass are the most commonly caught and harvested species. Walleye are generally third or fourth in total number. Bluegill, Black Crappie, Yellow Perch, and Northern Pike have all experienced excellent year classes in the recent past due to clear water and abundant aquatic vegetation and will continue to provide excellent opportunities in the next several years. <br> \n <br> \nThere are also many other fish species in Lake Pepin. There are over 120 fish species known to exist in this portion of the Mississippi River. <br> \n <br> \nThe fishing season for Walleye, Sauger, Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, and Northern Pike is open year-round, which differs from inland waters that have a closed season for these species from March 1 to mid-May in Minnesota. The \"border waters\" of Pool 4 where the MN/WI border water regulations apply are bounded by LD3 and LD4 on the up- and down-stream ends respectively, and by the railroad tracks that run parallel to the river on the MN and WI shorelines. <br> \n <br> \nThe start of the 2015 angling season on March 1st, 2015 represents the first time since the early 1990's that anglers will be allowed to legally target Lake Sturgeon in Pool 4.  As the statewide catch and release season opens for Lake Sturgeon in 2015 it will be interesting to see how much angling effort is focused on this species that had enjoyed huge growth in popularity on the Minnesota/Canada border waters in the past few decades. <br> \n <br> \nStarting in 2015 the season for Flathead Catfish will be closed to angling from December 1st to March 31st. <br> \n <br> \nHighlights from 2014 Lake Pepin Large Lake Survey:  <br> \n <br> \nTowards the end of 2013 anglers began reporting better catches of Sauger.  This is likely due to the growth of age-2 Sauger to acceptable size (13\"-14\").  Angling for Walleye and Sauger improved over the course of 2014 as smaller individuals of both species grew to sizes acceptable to anglers.  Though angling improved during 2014, the numbers of larger Sauger and Walleye anglers had become accustomed to seeing in the 2008-2010 period remained relatively rare.  A combination of several poor year classes in the early 2010s, the disappearance of several strong year classes from the early 2000s due to natural mortality, and record catches of YOY Gizzard Shad providing abundant forage likely have contributed to this lower success.  Angling for Walleye and Sauger should continue to improve in 2015 and into the next several years as the predicted strong 2013 year class recruits to the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and Bluegill should continue to provide excellent angling opportunities during 2015 based on the numbers of adult and juvenile fish sampled.  A recent tagging study involving White Bass from Pool 4 has shown that the White Bass population in Pool 4/Lake Pepin is very mobile with individuals tagged in Pool 4 moving as far upstream as the Apple River in Wisconsin and as far downstream as Pool 6.  This movement likely has contributed to the rapid swings in gill net catch rates from year to year and indicates that care must be taken when evaluating White Bass populations using Lake Pepin gill net catch rates. <br> \n <br> \nThe consistent Bluegill and Yellow Perch reproduction observed since 2004 should continue to provide good angling opportunities with quality sized fish available in 2014.  Three apparent strong year classes (2012-2014) of Black Crappies will enhance an already productive crappie fishery with individuals recruiting to the creel for the next four years. <br> \n <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

The 2017 outlook for Walleye and Sauger anglers should be positive.  The 2013 year class of Sauger that made up 74% of the 2015 Sauger gillnet catch and 48% of the 2016 gillnet catch should start the season at 13-18 inches (mean 15.4 inches) and end the season averaging approximately 18 inches providing numerous \"eater\" sized Sauger with good opportunities at bonus Sauger over 20 inches in length.  The strong 2013 and 2014 year classes of Walleye should provide anglers fish from 16-22 inches in length. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and Bluegill should continue to provide excellent angling opportunities during 2017 based on the numbers of adult and juvenile fish sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nThe consistent Bluegill and Yellow Perch reproduction observed since 2004 should continue to provide good angling opportunities with quality sized fish available in 2017.  Three apparent strong year classes (2012-2014) of Black Crappie will enhance an already productive crappie fishery with individuals recruiting to the creel for the next several years.  Black Crappie and Bluegill reproduction appears to have been down from the record levels observed in the last five years, but catch rates remained well above long term means for both species in 2016. <br> \n <br> \nThe start of the 2015 angling season on March 1st, 2015 represented the first time since the early 1990's that anglers were allowed to legally target Lake Sturgeon in Pool 4.  Wisconsin opened a season matching Minnesota's on their shared border waters in 2016.  After two open water seasons of catch and release angling targeting Lake Sturgeon on Pool 4, local interest in the species seems to be increasing.  Anglers on several occasions assisted DNR staff in their tagging efforts by providing hook and line caught individuals for tagging.   <br> \n</p>",

        "narrative": "<p>Anglers in 2017 continued to report improving size structure in both Walleye and Sauger, but experienced sometimes difficult fishing potentially due to high numbers of forage in the system.  The 2018 outlook for Walleye and Sauger anglers should be positive.  The 2013 year class of Sauger continues to contribute to catches providing 10.4% of the 2017 gill net catch.  During the 2018 angling season these fish should provide numerous opportunities at Sauger ranging from 16-20 inches in length.  The 2015 year class will also provide numbers of Sauger from 13-16 inches as they grow in 2018. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass, Yellow Perch, Black Crappie, and Bluegill should continue to provide excellent angling opportunities during 2017 based on the numbers of adult and juvenile fish sampled.  Northern Pike numbers have been down in the last few years, but opportunities for trophy pike are still available throughout the system, and abundant food sources can rapidly grow pike to catchable size when favorable spawning conditions occur. <br> \n <br> \nThe consistent Bluegill and Yellow Perch reproduction observed since 2004 should continue to provide good angling opportunities with quality sized fish available in 2018.  Three apparent strong year classes (2012-2014) of Black Crappie will enhance an already productive crappie fishery with individuals recruiting to the creel for the next several years.  Strong numbers of Black Crappie and Bluegill were noted during bass electrofishing efforts.  These fish were often just below the sizes considered harvestable by anglers, but should reach those sizes in 2018 as the summer progresses. <br> \n <br> \nThe start of the 2015 angling season on March 1st, 2015 represented the first time since the early 1990's that anglers were allowed to legally target Lake Sturgeon in Pool 4.  Wisconsin opened a season matching Minnesota's on their shared border waters in 2016.  After three open water seasons of catch and release angling targeting Lake Sturgeon on Pool 4, local interest in the species seems to be increasing.  Anglers on several occasions assisted DNR staff in their tagging efforts by providing hook and line caught individuals for tagging.   <br> \n <br> \n</p>",

TEMPERATURES RECORDED SINCE 1969 RANGED BETWEEN 55 AND 64. WATER LEVELS AT LOCK AND DAM #3 WERE 5.8 FT ABOVE NORMAL DURING THE SAMPLING PERIOD.

        "narrative": "<p>Angler Forecast <br> \n <br> \nAnglers in 2018 continued to report improving size structure in both Walleye and Sauger, but experienced sometimes difficult fishing potentially due to high numbers of forage in the system.  The 2019 outlook for Walleye and Sauger anglers should be positive.  The 2013 year class of Sauger continues to contribute to catches and make up 5.9% of the 2018 gill net catch.  During the 2019 angling season these, fish and those from the four older year classes sampled in 2018 should provide opportunities for 20 inch or greater Sauger.  The 2015 year class (39.5% of the 2018 gill net catch) will also provide numbers of Sauger from 13-19 inches in 2019 as they grow.  Apparently strong reproduction of both Walleye and Sauger in 2018 has led to numerous reports in the ongoing Pool 4 Large Lake Creel of their capture by anglers both on open water and through the ice.  Anglers should expect to encounter higher than normal numbers of Walleye and Sauger in the 5-9 inch range early in the season and the 8-13 inch range later as this group grows. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass, Yellow Perch, Black Crappie, and Bluegill should continue to provide excellent angling opportunities during 2018 based on the numbers of adult and juvenile fish sampled.  Northern Pike numbers rebounded to the third quartile after several down years, but opportunities for trophy pike are still available throughout the system, and abundant food sources can rapidly grow pike to catchable size when favorable spawning conditions occur. <br> \n <br> \nThe consistent Bluegill and Yellow Perch reproduction observed since 2004 should continue to provide good angling opportunities with quality sized fish available in 2019.  Four apparent strong year classes (2012-2014 and 2018) of Black Crappie will enhance an already productive crappie fishery with individuals recruiting to the creel for the next several years.  These fish should be considered harvestable by anglers, but smaller sizes will also be present and as always sorting will likely be required. <br> \n <br> \nThe start of the 2015 angling season on March 1st, 2015 represented the first time since the early 1990's that anglers were allowed to legally target Lake Sturgeon in Pool 4.  Wisconsin opened a season matching Minnesota's on their shared border waters in 2016.  After three open water seasons of catch and release angling targeting Lake Sturgeon on Pool 4, local interest in the species seems to be increasing.  Anglers on several occasions assisted DNR staff in their tagging efforts by providing hook and line caught individuals for tagging.   <br> \n <br> \n2018 Survey Highlights <br> \n <br> \nTrawling <br> \n <br> \nTrawling catch rate for YOY Gizzard Shad (109.5/hr) was the slightly lower than the recent high catch rate of 2017 and near the historic mean (104.2/hr) in 2018.  The catch rates for YOY Sauger (21.6/hr) and YOY Walleye (70.5/hr) were well above the long term means of 6.8/hr and 5.36/hr respectively.  In fact both were record high catch rates with Sauger just slightly higher than the previous record in 1987, while Walleye were captured at over three times the previous record rate from 2015.  The previous year class of record for Walleye (2001) was not sampled via trawl as young of year due to complications with excessive zebra mussel shells damaging fish in the trawl, but high Walleye catch rates in the 2018 trawl samples are supported by record catch rates of YOY Walleye in the truncated 2018 fall night electrofishing samples. <br> \n <br> \nFreshwater Drum (27.1%) and Troutperch (61.9%) dominated the non YOY catch by numbers, with Bluegill (2.1%), Sauger (1.7%), Yellow Perch (0.9%), Black Crappie (0.4%), and Walleye (0.6%) were the most numerous gamefish species sampled.   <br> \n <br> \nThe YOY Bluegill catch rate (691.4/hr) during the 2011 trawl netting was the highest recorded since inception of the large lake program and over five hundred times the long term mean at the time.  Prior to the extraordinarily high catch rate in 2011 the long term mean was 1.3/hr, but that mean increased to 27.9/hr when the outlying 2011 catches are included.  The 2018 trawl catch of YOY Bluegill was 17.7/hr .  This was above the long term mean of 1.3/hr prior to 2011 but below the long term mean with the 2011 catches included (24.9/hr).  The high catch rate in 2011 also means that caution is advised when using the long term mean catch rate for YOY Bluegill.  The increase in Bluegill catch in the trawl over the past decade may be a result of several years increased water clarity in lower Lake Pepin and a corresponding increase in aquatic vegetation providing improved spawning and nursery habitat for Bluegill and other centrarchids.   <br> \n <br> \nEight of the last nine years of trawling (the exception is 2014) have catch rates of adult/juvenile Bluegill higher than any previously recorded catch rates during the Large Lake Program period. <br> \n <br> \nStandard Electrofishing <br> \n <br> \nHigh water once again impacted fall sampling by preventing access to nearshore areas at some electrofishing stations.  The electrofishing catch rate for Smallmouth Bass in 2018 remained well above the long term mean, while Largemouth Bass have dropped below the long term mean.  Smallmouth Bass were represented by ten year classes.  Largemouth Bass were represented by seven year classes.  The 2018 Walleye catch rate (11.4/hour) was only half of the long term mean (22.4/hr), but may have been adversely impacted by high water that prevented effective electrofishing of their preferred habitat. <br> \n <br> \nNighttime Electrofishing <br> \n <br> \nDue to impending high water, fall electrofishing for YOY Walleye and Sauger was conducted on October 8-10, 2018 with water temperature of ~54?F and rising water conditions.  Only 2 stations were completed with a total catch of 1,071 Walleye and 339 Sauger.  Catch rates for both YOY Walleye (321.8/hr) and YOY Sauger (105.1/hr) in 2018 were well above the long term means (33.3/hr) and (79.3/hr)  respectively.  Young of year Walleye catch rates in fact are a new record high supporting the record numbers of YOY Walleye encountered in the 2018 trawl samples.  Mean length of YOY Walleye, however, was a record low in 2018 at 6.2 inches driven by a high catch of 5-6 inch fish. <br> \n <br> \nHigh water forced a 1-2 week delay in sampling in 2017 and during that time period there was a precipitous drop in water temperatures that may have pulled YOY Walleye and Sauger away from the nearshore habitats typically sampled.  Ultimately the 2017 sample was the smallest ever recorded, but the gill net sample of Walleye from the 2017 year class (Age-1) in October of 2018 made up 33.7% of the total Walleye catch supporting the perception that the 2017 YOY catch rates were not representative.  <br> \n <br> \nThe rising water levels during April 2018 that allowed full access to flooded terrestrial vegetation and likely was a contributor to what preliminarily looks like a very strong 2018 Walleye year class. <br> \n <br> \nGill Netting <br> \n <br> \nWater levels during gill netting in 2018 were 1-3 feet above normal long term mean water levels and rapidly rising.  Gill net catches of Black Crappie, Channel Catfish, Northern Pike, Sauger, and Yellow Perch were above average in 2018.  White Bass were sampled at slightly over half the long term mean catch rate and Yellow Perch that were sampled at approximately twice the long term mean catch rate. <br> \n <br> \nThe Walleye gill net CPUE in 2018 (4.1/net) dropped below the median.  Sauger gill net CPUE in 2017 (24.7/net) was above the median.  The Sauger gill net CPUE has remained within or above the interquartile range since 1997 with the exception of 2012 and 2013.  Changing conditions on Pool 4, particularly the recent number of mid-summer high water events and increasing water clarity may continue to influence Sauger populations in the near future. <br> \n <br> \nWhite Bass gill net CPUE (3.4/net) was just below the first quartile.  White Bass were aged with otoliths for the first time in 2009.  Results indicated a much older population than previously thought with fish to age-16 present.  Aging also revealed that White Bass growth slows dramatically beginning at age-3.  Reduced growth is likely due to the onset of sexual maturity and production of gametes.  Gill net sampling of White Bass on Lake Pepin has been quite variable over time.  It is unclear to what extent these fluctuations represent fish population changes (natality and mortality) versus movements within Pool 4 (utilization of pelagic habitats) or the Upper Mississippi Pools in general (immigration and emigration).  Data from a White Bass tagging project conducted by the Lake City and East Metro fisheries offices showed movements by fish tagged in Pool 4 to Pool 9 to the south.  More commonly, White Bass moved to, or through Pool 3, with upstream movement documented into Lake St. Croix, the St. Croix River, and as far upstream as the inland waters of the Apple River in Wisconsin.  Individual fish movements of approximately 135 river miles from where the fish was tagged were documented (DNR file data). <br> \n <br> \nYellow Perch catch rates were above the third quartile in 2018.  The Yellow Perch gill net CPUE (9.8/net) was over three times the long term median (2.9/net).  The CPUE of Yellow Perch 10 inches in length or longer (3.04/net) rebounded from a down year in 2017 to again a near record high in 2018.  The catch rate for Yellow Perch 10 inches or longer in length has been above the long term third quartile since 2009 with one exception (2010), and nine of the ten years with a CPUE greater than 1/net since 1965 have occurred in the last ten years.  Yellow Perch were aged using otoliths and the sample was dominated by age-3 (53.9%), age-1 (26.1%), and age-2 (11.3%) fish.  Six age classes were sampled in 2016 with the oldest being age-6.  The growth rate of Yellow Perch is high with fish averaging 9.1 inches at age-2.  Differences in growth and longevity by gender were evident.  Females were longer than males at each age for which data from both genders was available, however gill net catches from past years seem to indicate that the oldest Yellow Perch in the population tend to be male. <br> \n <br> \nChannel Catfish gill net CPUE had declined annually from 2004 to 2010, but there has been a generally increasing trend since 2010 and has remained in the interquartile range since 2013.  The 2018 gill net CPUE (3.88/net) was just below the third quartile and similar to the values recorded in the last four survey years.  The Northern Pike gill net CPUE in 2017 (0.83/net) was just below the long term third quartile.   <br> \n <br> \nYear-Class Strength Index <br> \n <br> \nBoth the 2013 and 2014 year classes of Walleye are near the third quartile for the Large Lake Program history (1986-present) and therefore borderline \"strong\" year classes, and the 2015 year class is above the third quartile and considered \"strong\".  The 2015 Walleye year class was the first standout year class since 2009, and the 2013-2015 year classes represent the only time in the 60 year history of recorded year classes that three strong or nearly strong year classes have been strung together.  Early indications based on trawl and fall electrofishing surveys conducted in 2018 suggest a very strong year class may have been produced in 2018.  Fall floods have hampered YOY sampling efforts in recent years (including 2015), but catch rates from fall electrofishing in 2018 were approximately  three times those seen when sampling the last really strong year class in 2009.  The year-class strength index for Sauger showed relatively weak year classes in 2010-2012 and 2014.  Gill netting and other sampling in 2015 affirmed the assertion that 2013 was a strong year for Walleye and Sauger reproduction.  Recent gill net sampling and year class strength calculations verified that the 2013 year class strength for Sauger was the fourth highest measured since the Large Lake Program started in 1986, and that the 2015 year class was the sixth highest. Early indications are that 2017 will also be strong, and though not as dramatic as what was seen with Walleye, strong Sauger reproduction also appears to have occurred in 2018. <br> \n</p>",

Walleye gill net catch has been above the long-term average for eight straight years.  Many age-1 and age-2 walleye were captured in the gill nets, which indicated good 2006 and 2007 year-classes.  Sauger gill net catch was average and sauger size was excellent.  Based on young-of-the-year electrofishing and gill nets, the 2007 sauger year-class appears to be the largest since the explosive 1998 year-class.   In addition, white bass, largemouth and smallmouth bass, bluegill, and crappie populations appeared healthy in Pool 4, therefore no changes in management strategies are recommended or warranted at this time.</p>",

        "narrative": "<p>Towards the end of 2013 anglers began reporting better catches of Sauger.  This is likely due to the growth of age-2 Sauger to acceptable size (13\"-14\").  Angling for Walleye and Sauger improved over the course of 2014 as smaller individuals of both species grew to sizes acceptable to anglers.  Though angling improved during 2014, the numbers of larger Sauger and Walleye anglers had become accustomed to seeing in the 2008-2010 period remained relatively rare.  A combination of several poor year classes in the early 2010s, the disappearance of several strong year classes from the early 2000s due to natural mortality, and record catches of YOY Gizzard Shad providing abundant forage likely have contributed to this lower success.  Angling for Walleye and Sauger should continue to improve in 2015 and into the next several years as the predicted strong 2013 year class recruits to the fishery. <br> \n <br> \nSmallmouth Bass, Largemouth Bass, Yellow Perch, Northern Pike, Black Crappie, and Bluegill should continue to provide excellent angling opportunities during 2015 based on the numbers of adult and juvenile fish sampled.  A recent tagging study involving White Bass from Pool 4 has shown that the White Bass population in Pool 4/Lake Pepin is very mobile with individuals tagged in Pool 4 moving as far upstream as the Apple River in Wisconsin and as far downstream as Pool 6.  This movement likely has contributed to the rapid swings in gill net catch rates from year to year and indicates that care must be taken when evaluating White Bass populations using Lake Pepin gill net catch rates. <br> \n <br> \nThe consistent Bluegill and Yellow Perch reproduction observed since 2004 should continue to provide good angling opportunities with quality sized fish available in 2014.  Three apparent strong year classes (2012-2014) of Black Crappies will enhance an already productive crappie fishery with individuals recruiting to the creel for the next four years. <br> \n <br> \nThe start of the 2015 angling season on March 1st, 2015 represents the first time since the early 1990's that anglers will be allowed to legally target Lake Sturgeon in Pool 4.  As the statewide catch and release season opens for Lake Sturgeon in 2015 it will be interesting to see how much angling effort is focused on this species that had enjoyed huge growth in popularity on the Minnesota/Canada border waters in the past few decades. <br> \n</p>",
